"103224356-0-8382";"According to the ancient spirit, the cultists summoned a Daedra. The Daedra is currently hidden with magic, but I can reveal it with this scroll of sight. I'll go to the base of the waterfall, use the scroll to reveal the Daedra, and kill it."
"103224356-0-8389";"The reflective spirit is holding Countess Ilise's true self within the mirror. I must enter the mirror and find her."
"103224356-0-8425";"I found <<1>>. I just need to guide her back to the mirror, so we can go back to the other side."
"103224356-0-8454";"I should search the top of Nightmare Crag for the Supernal Dreamers' ritual scroll."
"103224356-0-8455";"Now that I know how to summon the Daedra, I can light the braziers, just as the scroll instructs, and open a portal to Oblivion."
"103224356-0-8456";"The portal is active. I should go to the portal and summon the Daedra. Once the Daedra appears, I need to kill it and end the threat it presents."
"103224356-0-8474";"After I cleansed Azura's shrine, a Winged Twilight appeared. I should listen to what she has to say."
"103224356-0-8475";"Now that the items have all been placed on an altar, I should perform the ritual. Perry was very specific: first, use the Dremora heart, then light the candle, and finally, use the pristine Scamp heart."
"103224356-0-8480";"High King Emeric stands before the guillotine, surrounded by rioting citizens. If I speak to him, perhaps I can wake him from this dream."
"103224356-0-8493";"I defeated the Night Terror. Once again, it appears as though I am forced to enter Vaermina's realm of Quagmire."
"103224356-0-8495";"I should speak with Marlene in one of the houses at the Vanne Farm."
"103224356-0-8496";"Marlene doesn't believe that I can actually protect her. She asked me to show her proof. The head of a Dremora should do."

"103224356-0-8498";"I've convinced Phinis' sister to follow me. I should escort her back to her brother, who said he was inside a barn on the eastern edge of the farm."

"103224356-0-8536";"I must find and recover the three pieces of the sword."
"103224356-0-8537";"I should take the three fragments of the sword to the king's crypt in Aphren's Tomb."
"103224356-0-8538";"A shade of King Aphren appeared. Perhaps he knows what I need to do to reforge the sword."
"103224356-0-8539";"Princess Mira understood the significance of receiving her father's sword. She came to speak with him for the first time in centuries. I should speak with the king's spirit now to say goodbye."
"103224356-0-8541";"<<1>> gave me the names of the two suitors she suspects. She says I should start with <<2>> ."
"103224356-0-8542";"<<1>> claims he didn't give her the mirror. He said I should speak to <<2>> or <<3>> instead."
"103224356-0-8543";"<<1>> told me that the gentleman who dropped off the mirror went by the name 'Sirion'. He's somewhere north of town. I need to go after him."
"103224356-0-8545";"I spoke to <<1>> and <<2>>. There are two other persons of interest, <<3>> and <<4>>."

"103224356-0-8557";"Instead of Sirion, I found Elin held captive. She told me the Supernal Dreamers plan to attack the countess at Mathias's funeral. I need to warn the countess."
"103224356-0-8558";"I protected the countess from the Supernal Dreamers' ambush. I'm now to meet her back at the manse."
"103224356-0-8563";"I should report to <<1>> in Shinji's Scarp. He's at a house on the south end of the battlefield."
"103224356-0-8571";"I'll need to find all four focusing crystals and some combustion oil before we can relight the signal fire. The crystals are likely scattered among the slavers on the island, but the oil is on their ship."
"103224356-0-8611";"I must enter the ruins and rescue captured local folk."
"103224356-0-8612";"I've rescued Breton locals from necromancers before they could be sacrificed. I should report back to that Priestess of Stendarr, Pietine."
"103224356-0-8613";"King Aphren repaired the sword. He wants me to give it to Princess Mira to make amends. Her crypt is down the corridor from his. Of course, the mage, Blaise Pamarc, also expects me to bring the sword to him. Apparently, the choice is mine."
"103224356-0-8614";"I need to gather all the cursed skulls I can find."
"103224356-0-8615";"Now that I have all the cursed skulls, I must destroy them at the charnel heap in the tower. Destruction will end their suffering."

"103224356-0-8621";"Sir Hughes believes King Fahara'jad has a spy inside Alcaire Castle. Secret correspondences have been intercepted, signed with the alias ""Almandine."" Hughes has asked me to search the castle library for clues to the person's true identity."
"103224356-0-8622";"I managed to gain access to the castle library. Now I need to search through the books for clues to identify ""Almandine,"" the person sending messages to King Fahara'jad."

"103224356-0-8632";"I need to board the ship at the Koeglin Village docks. <<1>> says the ship is part of the slavers' plan of attack. I should see what the captain has to say about it."
"103224356-0-8633";"The captain claims his ledger will prove his legitimacy. Unfortunately, it's belowdecks where they have trapped the slavers. I'll just have to fight my way through to find it."
"103224356-0-8635";"<<1>> took the evidence I found in the constable's house and set matters straight around town. The crew of Tava's Bounty was able to come ashore and get aid, and Dame Dabienne was set free. I should speak to Dabienne."
"103224356-0-8642";"I should look for Lucas Oscent on the beach south of Koeglin Village. The boy's mother said he often went fishing down there."
"103224356-0-8644";"I should speak to <<1>> and make sure her son arrived home safely."
"103224356-0-8655";"Each time I reclaimed a piece of King Aphren's sword, Princess Mira's spirit appeared and cursed her father for abandoning her. I must carry the pieces of the sword into Aphren's Tomb. The entrance is at the western end of Aphren's Hold."
"103224356-0-8656";"Ganise asked me to search the northern barn for any sign of her father."
"103224356-0-8657";"A ritual was performed here recently. I should read the tattered book inside the barn and try to determine the ritual's purpose."

"103224356-0-8671";"My entrance into the libray is blocked by an extremely stubborn knight named Sir Gregory. Sir Gregory might be persuaded to leave his post if I can arouse the jealousy he feels over his flirtatious wife, Vendi. She's usually in the market."
"103224356-0-8672";"Sir Gregory's wife Vendi is being escorted home by another Knight named Sir Higgens. If I tell Sir Gregory, he might be convinced to abandon his post."
"103224356-0-8679";"Ganise has apparently been tied up in her house and the door's been locked. She thinks one of the Scamps might have eaten the key. Pretty gruesome, but I'll need to kill Scamps until I find it."

"103224356-0-8681";"The duchess asked me to speak with Thoda, the commander of the Redguards outside Alcaire Castle. To get his attention, she suggested I fight some of his soldiers to prove my mettle."
"103224356-0-8682";"One of the knights I first met, <<1>>, is apparently behind an attempt on Duchess Lakana's life. I should inform her at once."
"103224356-0-8692";"I found the ledger from the ship, Tava's Bounty. I can return to <<1>> and give it to him as proof of the captain's claims. Perhaps now he'll listen to reason."
"103224356-0-8693";"I should tell <<1>> about Dame Falhut's betrayal."
"103224356-0-8694";"<<1>> asked me to go and apprehend <<2>> on a charge of treason. I'll find her residence north of the inn."

"103224356-0-8703";"Sir Hughes seems to have gone mad. He murdered Duchess Lakana because of his nightmares. I should speak with Duke Nathaniel."
"103224356-0-8709";"Now that I have Sir Edain's blade, I must use it on each spectral opponent before I destroy it, so I can trap their spirits. I should bind the souls of Arie, Gilbert, and Emory of The Three."

"103224356-0-8721";"I encountered the spirit of Sir Edain, once a Knight of the Flame. He begged me to lay to rest several angry ghosts of the brigands of Windridge Cave. I can bind them in his enchanted blade and then cast it into a fissure deep inside the caves."
"103224356-0-8723";"I've bound the souls of The Three. Now I must cast Sir Edain's sword into the fissure deep inside Windridge Caves."
"103224356-0-8731";"The duke believes Hughes returned to Firebrand Keep, southeast of Alcaire Castle. I should go there and ask the Knights of the Flame if they've seen him."

"103224356-0-9696";"They plan to assassinate King Casimir! The masterminds behind it are referred to as Verrik and Angof. Verrik is hiding in the harbor, preparing to strike. I must get this information to Captain Aresin immediately."
"103224356-0-9697";"The note appears to be a shopping list. I should speak to people who might sell the items on the list and see if anyone knows the dead man."
"103224356-0-9698";"The shopping list is some kind of code. ""Three blood oranges"" means someone is going to die, ""black roses"" means dark nature magic is involved, and the crescent emblem signifies the royal family of Casimir. I should tell Captain Aresin about this."

"103224356-0-9705";"I acquired a number of wolf's woe plants. They should allow the hostages to avoid the guard wolves and sneak out of the camp to escape. I also found a key I can use to free them."
"103224356-0-9708";"Grenna, an agent of the crown who's disguised as a commoner, asked me to go to the inn's second level and confront a suspicious character she's been watching. He goes by the name of Leveque."
"103224356-0-9718";"I need to disarm the traps to clear a path for the hostages. I should also create a diversion. Burning the Red Rooks' boat and archery platform should distract the bandits. Plus, the smoke will make it hard for the bandits to spot the nobles."
"103224356-0-9719";"Now that the hostages have escaped, I should return to Captain Farlivere and let her know what happened."
"103224356-0-9720";"I promised Lady Noellaume that I would recover her stolen jewelry box and return it to her after she's safely away from the Red Rook bandits. If I find the Orc named Tharkul, I should find the lockbox."
"103224356-0-9721";"I defeated Tharkul and recovered Lady Noellaume's lockbox. I should return it to her once she's safely away from the Red Rook bandits."

"103224356-0-9738";"Wyress Helene asked me to collect essences of Aetherius using a torchbug she gave me. She wants to craft a spell using the essences that will protect the villagers. Using the torchbug should lead me in the right direction."
"103224356-0-9739";"The ritual worked and the mill is safe. I should speak to Wyress Helene inside the mill and see what else needs to be done."
"103224356-0-9740";"Bernard Redain and his family escaped from Deleyn's Mill. He suggested I speak to the wyrd sisters and see what I can do to help."

"103224356-0-9743";"The innkeeper Lafont claims he's innocent. He said that the pig has escaped before and always heads into the northeast alleys to root around for something to eat. I should see if Glutton's over there."
"103224356-0-9744";"I entered the northeast alley and spotted Glutton rooting around in a garden. I should grab the pig and make sure it's safe."
"103224356-0-9745";"Zhagush gro-Korlag works with the Mages Guild and is something of a plant expert. Wickton suggested I ask Zhagush about the strange vine I found in the alley."
"103224356-0-9746";"The swineherd believes that Gregoire Lafont the innkeeper stole his pig and intends to serve it for dinner at the Rosy Lion Inn. I should ask Lafont about this."
"103224356-0-9749";"I extinguished many of the fires and sent the surviving villagers to the mill. I should return to Wyress Jehanne and see what else needs to be done."
"103224356-0-9750";"I need to search for surviving villagers and send them to the mill. While I'm doing that, I should put out as many fires as I can with water drawn from the village well."
"103224356-0-9751";"<<1>> gave me an amulet that I can use to reveal hidden werewolves. If I point the amulet at Camlorn refugees and activate the spell, any werewolves hiding among them will be revealed."
"103224356-0-9752";"I uncovered and killed the werewolves infiltrating Aldcroft, I should return to the Duke and let him know his suspicions were correct."
"103224356-0-9756";"I nourished the roots of the Wyrd Tree with the pure life energy of the forest creatures. I should return to Wyress Jehanne and see if she can call of the magic of the Wyrd now."
"103224356-0-9759";"I found the murderer. It was a werewolf! Matthew said Lieutenant Dubois might offer a reward for dealing with this. I should talk to him."
"103224356-0-9760";"Gloria's blood cured the Duke. At least she didn't die in vain. Now that the Duke has recovered, I should speak with him."
"103224356-0-9761";"Sergeant Armoil and his soldiers faced the werewolves at Camlorn and even managed to capture one of the creatures. The Duke thinks he can help me acquire a werewolf for Gloria's ritual."
"103224356-0-9762";"With the help of Battlemage Lexi, who captured a werewolf at Camlorn, we should be able to retrieve one of the creatures for Gloria. We need to search for a werewolf outside of Aldcroft and then I need to weaken it so Battlemage Lexi can trap it."
"103224356-0-9763";"I brought the captured werewolf to the cave. Now to go inside and find Gloria."
"103224356-0-9771";"I need to kill the monsters near the roots of the Wyrd Tree. That will nourish the roots with their life force and replenish the magic. If I kill a creature too far from a root, its life force will be wasted."
"103224356-0-9775";"The werewolf is safely trapped in the ritual circle. I should let Gloria know that we're ready to begin the ritual."
"103224356-0-9777";"After searching the alleys, I found another murder victim and heard that some kind of monster was seen prowling along the river's edge. I should search there."
"103224356-0-9779";"Matthew suggested I search the alleys of Daggerfall's trade district for clues about the brutal murders of the city's poor. I'll check the South Alley first."
"103224356-0-9781";"Leon told me to start by fighting the town's invaders as Rosalind did. I should also look for a keepsake of hers, something to strengthen the bond that will form between us."
"103224356-0-9782";"I retraced Rosalind's path, destroying skeletal raiders and protecting the town. As I lit the signal fire, I saw a vision of Rosalind. Her next stop was to check on the innkeeper. I should do that as well."
"103224356-0-9786";"The innkeeper said that Muriel the Apothecary needs hawthorn berries to make more healing poultices for the wounded guards in town. Rosalind's next step was to collect the berries. I should examine the hawthorn shrubs to find berries."
"103224356-0-9790";"As I used healing poultices to help several of Westtry's ghostly soldiers, Lieutenant Marlene called to me. I should talk to her."
"103224356-0-9792";"I witnessed the events leading to Leon's betrayal of Westtry. Leon rejected Stendarr and sold his soul to Molag Bal while Rosalind watched. I should talk to Leon about this."
"103224356-0-9793";"Gloria can tell me more about the ritual she plans to perform."
"103224356-0-9799";"The ritual revealed Angof's role in Faolchu's return from the dead. I should talk to <<1>> about what we've seen."

"103224356-0-9805";"Rosalind Milielle gave me the Gem of Westtry's Torment. I can use the gem to free the spirits of innocent villagers around Westtry."

"103224356-0-9825";"The spirit from the past stands before a set of armor that radiates magic. I should speak to the spirit and find out why she led me here."
"103224356-0-9826";"Conjurer Grahla asked me to collect ancient relics from the battle site. They'll help a researcher named Sarvith cast a divinatory spell to look into the past."
"103224356-0-9828";"I should take the ancient blades I found to <<1>>. He plans to use them as focus items in his divinatory spell."

"103224356-0-9887";"I killed several of the crocodiles that roam the bog and yanked out their teeth. I should travel to a camp near Dwynnarth Ruins and claim the bounty from Hoster Marceau."
"103224356-0-9888";"The Aldcroft lighthouse and cottages are on the southern coast of Aldcroft. I should look there for Edrien's pipe."

"103224356-0-12892";"<<1>> told me he saw the Goblins dragging <<2>> to the cave on the beach. I may find him there, if he still lives."
"103224356-0-12893";"<<1>> asked me to search for signs of <<2>> and <<3>>. He suggested that I look in spider cocoons east of the manor house."
"103224356-0-12899";"When I found <<1>>, he asked me to slay the <<2>>. It's inside a cave at the bottom of a waterfall east of <<3>>."
"103224356-0-12902";"The spirits of Othrenis have been satisfied. I should be able to find Mavos now. I should speak to Onuja and find Mavos' grave."
"103224356-0-12904";"Mavos needs me to make contact with the altar to complete the ritual. He's confident the spell will work, but he isn't confident that we'll survive."
"103224356-0-12905";"I must defend the hall from attacking Goblins."
"103224356-0-12906";"I summoned the guardians, just as Magister Enuse instructed. Now I should speak with Mavos."
"103224356-0-12911";"Guar have stampeded and scattered throughout the sulfur pools. They're peaceful creatures, but I'll still need to persuade them to return to their stables."
"103224356-0-12912";"I've sent a number of guar back to the stables. I should check to make sure they've made it there safely."
"103224356-0-12915";"<<1>> told me to find the shrine entrance to the base of the monument. It's just a little way north up the road."

"103224356-0-12931";"I've collected enough Graven Caps. I must seek out Bala near Mavos' tomb in Othrenis."
"103224356-0-12932";"Once I find Eanen's tomb, I must use the bit of dust she gave me to raise Eanen's spirit."

"103224356-0-12937";"I need to remove the bars keeping the gates closed. That should allow Tanval and Holgunn to lead the Dark Elves and Nords into the fort."
"103224356-0-12938";"Each of the races in the Pact—Nords, Dark Elves, and Argonians—have a reason to avoid working with the others. I must seek out a representative of each one, so I can figure out how to unite the factions."
"103224356-0-12939";"<<1>>, the architect of the racial strife in Ebonheart, has been killed. <<2>> will want to know his town is now free of Covenant agents."

"103224356-0-12960";"Mudcrabs are common around the shores of the Argonian quarter north of Ebonheart. Their meat is a convenient fertilizer. Ashreed grows in the shallow waters. It would work well as a wrapper for crab meat."
"103224356-0-12961";"I've collected crab meat and ashreeds. I'm ready to fertilize the Hist sapling. It stands on an island near the center of the Argonian quarter north of Ebonheart."
"103224356-0-12962";"<<1>> was half-crazed from imbibing Hist sap, but he clearly identified a Dunmer named Rhavil. He was the one who told him about the mind-altering qualities of tree sap. <<2>> appeared angry at this revelation."
"103224356-0-12965";"Telvanni mages want to soothe those affected by the curse in Heimlyn. <<1>> asked me to collect <<zm:2>> from the <<zm:3>> and <<zm:4>> from the <<zm:5>>."
"103224356-0-12966";"Field assistants are guarding a few residents of the keep huddled in living quarters. I should talk to them and let the totem's aura affect them. I must convince them to leave."
"103224356-0-12967";"When the curse was unleashed, a Covenant captain fled to the top of the keep's tower. I should see if she's still there."
"103224356-0-12968";"I've collected the ingredients needed by the Telvanni. I need to deliver them to <<1>> in the southern part of the keep."
"103224356-0-12969";"<<1>> has come up with a more effective counter to the curse: a <<2>>. She wants me to create the totem using an artifact called a Daedric Urn."
"103224356-0-12970";"<<1>> believes the way to cleanse the curse is by summoning and defeating its creators,  <<2>> and <<3>>. I need to open their soul cages to summon and disrupt them."

"103224356-0-12981";"I've fertilized the Hist sapling as best I can. <<1>> asked me to meet her back at her lodge."
"103224356-0-12982";"While I was gathering the fertilizer for the Hist sapling, the Argonians caught a Dunmer of House Dres trying to reach the tree. <<1>> agreed to let me speak to the mer and find out why he did this."
"103224356-0-12983";"I've made my way into the cellar. Ulov said the creature, however it looks now, should be here."
"103224356-0-12984";"I must find Ulov Stormwall to learn why he massacred his troops. Feldsii said he was just up the road from where I met her."
"103224356-0-12986";"After slaying the soldier's double, a gruesome shape rose from the corpse and fled into the stables. I should chase after it before it finds a new body."
"103224356-0-12987";"There's a woman standing in the entryway of the stables. I should speak to her. If she can't speak, I'll know the creature has found a new body."
"103224356-0-12988";"The Khajiiti idol Ruvali used to frighten the creature is in the bedroom of her house. The only house is on the plantation is to the west. I need to fetch that totem."
"103224356-0-12989";"I found the totem. I must return to Ruvali. I also found her husband's corpse."
"103224356-0-12990";"Tiril's double is standing in the foyer of Ruvali's house. I must find and warn Ruvali."
"103224356-0-12991";"I must prove to Ruvali that the creature before us is the monster, not her husband."
"103224356-0-12992";"I must kill Tiril's double."
"103224356-0-12993";"<<1>> believes the key to unraveling this magical corruption lies with Keeper Vildras, the guardian of the reliquary. I need to seek him out and find out if he will help us."
"103224356-0-12994";"Azeenus wants me to burn boats and kill the pirate captain. Captain Sa'dir sleeps in the rigging of his ship, but he will come running if he hears the storm warning bell."

"103224356-0-12998";"A simulacrum of Seeks-the-Night has appeared in front of me. I should speak to it and see what it has to say."
"103224356-0-12999";"The Ghost Snake doesn't care what the Mabrigash decide, so long as they continue to honor and care for the Vale. I should return to the Farseer now."
"103224356-0-13000";"I decided that the Mabrigash and the Hlaalu should trade with each other."
"103224356-0-13001";"I need to use the snake totem to determine Raston's fate. If I give the totem to Raston, he'll be welcome in the Vale. If I burn the totem in the fire, he'll become a servant of the Ghost Snake. Or I can suggest a third option to Bodani."
"103224356-0-13002";"I decided that the Mabrigash will remain isolated. The merchant will serve Ghost Snake."
"103224356-0-13003";"Farseer Bodani crafted a totem. She thinks it will help in some way. I need to retrieve it from her tent."
"103224356-0-13004";"This snake totem has some role in deciding the merchant's fate. I'll give it to the Farseer."

"103224356-0-13020";"I can use the <<1>> to travel to the hidden vault."
"103224356-0-13021";"A cat named Star is supposed to lead me to the secret meeting place. I need to follow the cat and see where she takes me."
"103224356-0-13022";"I discovered a group of villagers meeting in secret on the lower level of a locked building. One of them is <<1>>. I should speak to her and find out what's going on."
"103224356-0-13023";"I've been asked to help Slips-Through-Fingers and her friends. They want to rescue the abducted villagers, but they aren't soldiers. They have no idea what they're in for."
"103224356-0-13025";"I've decided not to aid Madras. He's just going to get his people killed. I should tell one of the guards about this before Madras and his group do something foolish."
"103224356-0-13026";"I found a guard right outside. I explained what was going on. She doesn't want to see anyone get hurt, so she's devised a plan to disrupt the meeting."
"103224356-0-13027";"I need to catch rats to disrupt Madras's meeting. I should be able to find rats running around Narsis."
"103224356-0-13029";"I need to bring these rats to the secret meeting and drop them at the door. Hopefully, that will slow Madras down."
"103224356-0-13030";"The rats did their job. They disrupted the meeting and caused people to flee the building. I should speak to <<1>> again."
"103224356-0-13031";"Guard Rila knows where the missing people are being held. She wants me to report back to the kinhouse and meet her there."
"103224356-0-13036";"I need to seal the vials spewing fumes into the middle and lower chambers. I should also give the potion to any miners I find."
"103224356-0-13037";"I told <<1>> that his wife was behind the sabotage in the mine."
"103224356-0-13038";"I can bring any cuttle I collect back to Orona, but I made no promises."

"103224356-0-13044";"I was unable to grab the weapons for the villagers in time. I need to report back to <<1>> and see what our next step is."
"103224356-0-13045";"I need to blow the whistle in front of the kinhouse. That will signal the others to distract the guards."
"103224356-0-13046";"I returned to the kinhouse, but Ralden isn't around. One of his advisors, Varon Davel, wants to speak to me."
"103224356-0-13047";"Ralden asked me to speak to Giron Sadri, upstairs in the kinhouse. Ralden wants me to do whatever he asks."
"103224356-0-13048";"Giron believes the Maulborn camped by the lake have something to do with the troubles in Narsis. He asked me to reduce their numbers while searching for anything that links them to the missing villagers or the Llodos Plague."
"103224356-0-13049";"I found orders that suggest some vile substance was poured into the lake at the waterfall. I should go to the waterfall and look around."
"103224356-0-13050";"The strange woman named Naryu has appeared again. She wants to speak to me. I should be ready for anything."
"103224356-0-13051";"I've tried the plan proposed by the Rii brothers. An Argonian named <<1>> tried to get my attention as I finished talking to Furon. I should see what she has to say."
"103224356-0-13052";"I've bound one of the dead soldiers. I need to lead the soldier's spirit to <<1>>."
"103224356-0-13053";"<<1>> wants to force the spirits into the great beyond. She's asked me to use the <<2>> on one of the spirits of the battlefield."
"103224356-0-13054";"I need to tell <<1>> that the <<2>> was able to release the spirit."
"103224356-0-13056";"I returned to the kinhouse, but Ralden isn't around. One of his advisors, Varon Davel, wants to speak to me."
"103224356-0-13057";"Naryu says Giron is connected to the Maulborn. Apparently, he's responsible for shipping the Llodos Plague into Narsis. She suggested I return to the kinhouse as soon as possible."
"103224356-0-13067";"I learned about ruins to the west of Narsis where Giron and the missing villagers might be. I've got a key and just need to find the entrance."
"103224356-0-13068";"I should tell Varon what I discovered."
"103224356-0-13070";"I found the entrance to the ruins. Now I need to use the key and get inside."
"103224356-0-13071";"I'm inside the ruins and the place is crawling with Maulborn. I need to find Giron and put an end to this."
"103224356-0-13072";"Councilor Ralden and the missing villagers should be here somewhere. I need to make sure they're all right."
"103224356-0-13073";"Varon and the guards are waiting for me. I should speak to Varon."
"103224356-0-13075";"The person I helped should be waiting outside. I need to find her so she can tell me where the villagers are being held."
"103224356-0-13078";"I should investigate what happened here. I'll follow the path of debris that leads to the northeast, away from the main road."
"103224356-0-13079";"<<1>> said they'd captured a raider wearing the insignia of House Dres. The lieutenant is concerned about Dark Elf house politics and asked me to speak to the captive."
"103224356-0-13080";"Defender Maera saw a well-dressed Dark Elf head into the Mzithumz ruins with the Dwarven control rod. It has to be Ithis Omalor, scion of House Dres. She asked me to enter the ruins and find him."
"103224356-0-13081";"I found Ithis Omalor. I should confront him about his complicity in the caravan attack."
"103224356-0-13082";"I interrogated Ithis Omalor and learned that Magistrix Vox sent him to attack the Hlaalu caravan. I refused to grant him leniency for his crimes and sent him running to his death in the depths of Mzithumz."
"103224356-0-13083";"I accompanied Ithis Omalor out of the Dwarven ruins of Mzithumz. I should speak with Guard Maera."
"103224356-0-13084";"To prove the rest of the Pact can fight, <<1>>, the leader of the sawyers, expects me to defeat three of his men in single combat … while drunk on Nord mead."
"103224356-0-13085";"<<1>> still has more to say."
"103224356-0-13086";"The Nords won't accept my challenge unless I'm obviously drunk with mead. There's a keg of mead near <<1>>."
"103224356-0-13089";"I pummeled several Nords. I should return to <<1>> to see if he's suitably impressed."
"103224356-0-13090";"Caravan Master Girano is concerned about his employer's cargo. He wants me to recover the stolen cargo and its manifest from the raiders. The cargo is in crates and a Dres leader should have the manifest. I should find both to the north."
"103224356-0-13091";"I recovered Girano's cargo and manifest. I should return both to him."
"103224356-0-13093";"<<1>> has a plan to bind the spirits in service. I need to use the <<z:2>> on a weakened spirit, so I can test the method out."
"103224356-0-13097";"I should kill any Goblins or spiders I encounter around <<1>>."
"103224356-0-13100";"The Nords won't accept my challenge unless I'm obviously drunk on mead. Fortunately, I have a <<z:1>>."
"103224356-0-13106";"<<1>> plans to kill the Goblin Warlord. I should find him deeper in the cave and offer my help."
"103224356-0-13107";"The General claims Ragna Stormcrag is a Nord spy. There's something strange going on here, but I'll find Ragna and see what she has to say."
"103224356-0-13108";"I should present myself to House General Gavryn Redoran. He should be in the main keep."
"103224356-0-13109";"Ragna Stormcrag doesn't look like a spy to me. I should talk to her."
"103224356-0-13110";"The General's bodyguard, Ragna Stormcrag, believes the General is behaving strangely. She wants me to go to the lower level of the keep and convince the guard to let me search the General's quarters."
"103224356-0-13111";"I should tell Ragna about this new retainer and the meeting at the ruins by the river."
"103224356-0-13114";"<<1>> needs someone to pray at three shrines surrounding Ebonheart, one for each leader of the Tribunal. He's hoping for a message from the gods, but expects only silence, and he's unwilling to face that himself."
"103224356-0-13115";"I've told <<1>> about the messages the Tribunal gave me. He found that encouraging."
"103224356-0-13118";"If Ulov is correct, the monster killed the soldier whose body it copied. I should look in the cellar for the original body."
"103224356-0-13141";"I must travel to Fort Virak. I need to help Pact soldiers retake it."
"103224356-0-13142";"As I was warned, all three shrines were troubled by ravenous alits. However, that had nothing to do with disapproval by the Tribunal. They were drawn by piles of offal left near each shrine. I should return to <<1>> with this news."
"103224356-0-13148";"I'm giving this thing to Markiel!"
"103224356-0-13149";"I located the cave. Now I need to find the captured Hlaalu scouts."
"103224356-0-13153";"One document in the General's quarters indicates that he intends to execute Captain Valec Doronil. A second mentions that he has appointed an unnamed personal retainer to the mess tent. I should look into both of these leads."
"103224356-0-13154";"The guard agreed to let me look around. I need to check the General's quarters for anything suspicious."
"103224356-0-13155";"It seems <<1>> made a deal with the Thalmor, the military force of the Dominion in Shadowfen. <<2>> should hear about this immediately."
"103224356-0-13156";"I should find out what the Dark Elf was doing in this dangerous town. Perhaps I could find out how he ended up in the stocks."
"103224356-0-13157";"I need to get this ""leader's"" attention by roughing up some of her pirates. <<1>> said I could find them drinking in the town's bar, in the hold of a beached ship."
"103224356-0-13158";"I won the right to speak to <<1>>, the leader of <<2>>. Her thugs said she would be in the captain's quarters of the beached ship, on the main deck."
"103224356-0-13159";"I need to speak to the contact One-Eye found. I should see what he knows about the new Khajiit pirate in <<1>>. He should be waiting on the main deck of the beached ship."
"103224356-0-13160";"I learned the name of this Khajiit pirate leader: it's <<1>>. <<2>> told me one of her pirates would be meeting with a Dominion contact in the warehouse very soon. I should hurry there and find a suitable hiding place."
"103224356-0-13161";"<<1>> has made a deal with the Thalmor, the military force of the Dominion in Shadowfen. <<2>> should hear about this immediately."
"103224356-0-13163";"The person I'm looking for is called ""One-Eye."" I won't be able to gain an audience with her without some violence."
"103224356-0-13169";"The warehouse probably has some crates I could hide in while listening to the meeting."
"103224356-0-13170";"I defeated my opponent and completed the Trial of the Fang. I should speak to <<1>>."
"103224356-0-13171";"I awakened Hissmir's Zaht stones. I should inform <<1>> that Hissmir doesn't need to fear Dominion reprisals."
"103224356-0-13172";"I recovered the stolen relics. I should return them to <<1>>."
"103224356-0-13173";"I slew the killers of the missing pilgrims. I should tell <<1>> of their fate."
"103224356-0-13174";"To complete the Trial of the Fang, I need to defeat a Hissmir warrior while under the influence of <<1>>."
"103224356-0-13175";"To complete the Trial of the Mind, I must understand which elements of Argonian history match up. Three Argonian texts should provide clues."
"103224356-0-13177";"I need to speak with <<1>> to discuss my performance in the Trial of the Heart. I can find him southeast of the pyramid."
"103224356-0-13178";"I've completed the Trial of the Mind. I should speak with <<1>> about the next trial."
"103224356-0-13179";"The Maulborn plan to ship crates of Llodos Plague into Mournhold and infect the whole city. Scout Mamyne suggested I kill Maulborn cultists in the camp to get forged manifests. That should slow them down."
"103224356-0-13181";"I volunteered to locate the Hlaalu scouting party and find out what's going on in the gorge."
"103224356-0-13187";"I persuaded the races in Ebonheart to work together and defend the town. It seems each had some contact with a manipulative Dark Elf named <<1>>. <<2>> will certainly want to hear about his activities."
"103224356-0-13188";"<<1>> asked me to investigate <<2>>. He has a house in town. He'd like me to wait outside and follow Rhavil when he leaves. Drathus cast a spell that will allow him to see what I see and communicate instructions to me."
"103224356-0-13189";"Rhavil has left his house. I should follow him, but I must be careful not to get too close."
"103224356-0-13190";"Rhavil entered a shack by the docks. Drathus asked me to wait until he leaves so we can investigate."
"103224356-0-13191";"Rhavil has left. Drathus asked me to enter the shack and investigate."
"103224356-0-13193";"Drathus wants me to return to Rhavil Urano's house look for more evidence. His house is in the southwest quarter of the city, near the Tribunal Temple. He probably won't come quietly."
"103224356-0-13197";"I could also just buy the items from Donkey"
"103224356-0-13199";"Neposh is the only slave at the mine who managed to stay out of the Daedra's clutches. He has a plan to free people taken to Oblivion. He suggested I recovered firesap gel, an Argonian mixture confiscated by the Dark Elves."
"103224356-0-13200";"Last-to-Water has escaped from Oblivion. I should speak again with Neposh."
"103224356-0-13201";"The entrance to the ruins is down by the river, beyond the north gate of the fortress. I need to head there and enter the crypts."
"103224356-0-13202";"Now that I'm inside the ruins, I should see if I can find Durel Gilveni, the General's retainer. The Maulborn have infiltrated this area, so I need to be careful."

"103224356-0-13204";"I informed Captain Valec about what I found in the ruins beneath Tal'Deic Fortress. I should see if he needs anything else from me."

"103224356-0-13209";"I challenged members of the corrupt Redoran Sentinels and defeated them in combat. I should tell Commander Taldyn what happened."
"103224356-0-13217";"I recovered the <<z:1>>. I should return it to <<2>>."
"103224356-0-13218";"I gathered the shipping manifests. That should delay the shipment. I need to return to <<1>> to discuss our next move."
"103224356-0-13219";"I recovered the firesap from a slaver's sack. Neposh hopes that pouring the firesap onto Oblivion's crystals should cause them to crack. That might return his people home."
"103224356-0-13220";"I should check in with <<1>>. He's probably in the area where the Fighters and Mages Guilds are in Stormhold."
"103224356-0-13221";"<<1>> asked me to speak to the families of the murder victims. I have to find out about Arilin Maralvel, Eroni Omobar, and Naldyn Indalor. If I need help, I should ask <<1>> for more information."
"103224356-0-13222";"Now that I've spoken to the people on <<1>>'s list, I should enter the mortuary so I can examine the bodies. <<2>> gave me a key to get inside. He said I can find the mortuary on the outskirts of Stormhold."
"103224356-0-13223";"After examining the bodies, I heard a woman say she has a message for me in the mortuary. I should find out what she wants."
"103224356-0-13224";"<<1>> approached me in the mortuary. She asked me to meet <<2>> at his home. <<2>> swears he saw his wife, Eroni.\n\n<<1>> said I can find <<2>> on the east side of Stormhold, and she urged me to hurry. She believes Gethis may be in danger."
"103224356-0-13225";"<<1>> told me the woman who attacked him may still be in his home. I should go inside and see what I can find."
"103224356-0-13226";"I returned to <<1>>, but he wasn't there. I should speak to <<2>>. She seems eager to speak to me."
"103224356-0-13227";"I discovered a dead Shadowscale scout inside <<1>>'s home. The scout had a journal claiming the Shadowscales aren't responsible for Eroni's death.\n\nI should bring the journal to <<2>>. He's probably still by the guildhall in Stormhold."
"103224356-0-13228";"I'm in the ruined corridors beneath Fort Virak. I must avoid ghosts prowling the ""otherworld"" while making my way to the area exit. I should be able to leave the ghost-infested corridors through the far broken wall."
"103224356-0-13229";"Scout Mamyne asked me to head to the cave and look for the rest of the scouting party. She plans to report to Captain Diiril. I should see what's going on in that cave."

"103224356-0-13233";"<<1>> revealed they have a spy named <<2>> investigating recent crimes. She asked me to go to his home on the west side of Stormhold, so I can find out what sort of information he's gathered."
"103224356-0-13234";"I entered Listens-to-Water's home and found him dead. I should search the room for any sign of the reports he was keeping for <<1>>."
"103224356-0-13235";"I should go to the Ayleid entrance described in Listens-to-Water's report, so I can investigate. The report said the entrance is on the west side of the ruins in Stormhold."
"103224356-0-13236";"Now that I've entered the ruins, I should investigate them to see what I can find."
"103224356-0-13237";"While I was investigating the ruins, I heard the voice of <<1>> calling out to me. I should rescue him."
"103224356-0-13238";"Now that I've released all the prisoners, I should find <<1>> outside the ruins."
"103224356-0-13239";"After I rescued <<1>>, he asked me to continue through the ruins. He asked me to release people who have been kidnapped."
"103224356-0-13240";"<<1>> said cultists raided the village last night, but guards tricked three of their lieutenants within their cellars. I agreed to convince the Worm Cultists to surrender."
"103224356-0-13241";"He asked me to convince some of the mercenaries around Stormhold to leave. <<1>> said he didn't care how I did it."
"103224356-0-13242";"Not as many mercenaries patrol Stormhold. I should return to <<1>> and deliver the news."
"103224356-0-13243";"<<1>> wasn't at his stall, but there's a Nord standing nearby. Perhaps she knows where he went."
"103224356-0-13248";"I met an injured Pact soldier on the road from Vivec's Antlers. The Covenant has invaded the area, and the Pact is heavily outnumbered. The soldier asked me to speak to his superior, Captain Noris, in a camp by the north sea."
"103224356-0-13249";"None of the Worm Cult lieutenants would surrender. I should inform <<1>>."
"103224356-0-13250";"<<1>> said that an Argonian named <<2>> may know more about the Brother of Strife, the Coral Heart, and Alexandra Conele's plans to acquire it. She may also be able to tell me more about what's happening in Vivec's Antlers."
"103224356-0-13258";"I need to find <<1>> and tell her what I've learned."
"103224356-0-13259";"I should talk to <<1>> about the Vanguard."

"103224356-0-13263";"The grandmaster told me to talk to his seneschal, <<1>>, if I need anything."
"103224356-0-13264";"Now that I'm inside the barracks, I need to look around for clues. I must learn where the grandmaster's son is being held."
"103224356-0-13269";"I must search for <<1>> within the Daedric tombs and set him free."
"103224356-0-13271";"Ral gave me the prod he uses when tending his herd. I need to use the prod on the guar as I find them around Kragenmoor. That should send them back to Ral."
"103224356-0-13272";"<<1>> fears the cultists plan to enslave the living skeletons of <<2>>. She told me <<3>> has a way to stop the cultists' plan, but it requires my help. I should speak with him."
"103224356-0-13274";"House Indoril is ready to dispel the ward holding the gate closed. I need to wait while Garyn and Tanval open the gates."
"103224356-0-13275";"With the ward down, I'm free to enter the area around the keep."
"103224356-0-13276";"This is it. I must slay <<1>>."
"103224356-0-13279";"The pirates consorting with Dominion troops on the docks of <<1>> know where <<2>> is holed up. If I show them I mean business by smashing a few heads, they may be more amenable to talking."
"103224356-0-13280";"I got the information I needed from the pirates working for <<1>>, along with the key I needed to get in to the warehouse on the docks. I need to go to the warehouse and find the trapdoor to her hideout."
"103224356-0-13283";"<<1>> wants me to kill <<2>> in her hideout. Hopefully, that will stop the trafficking of Dominion supplies into Shadowfen."
"103224356-0-13284";"In the underground hideout, a Khajiit approached me, right after killing his leader. I should speak to him and find out what he wants."
"103224356-0-13285";"The treasure <<1>> expected to be in the Khajiit's hideout was not there. A pirate named <<2>> said he and his gang would be willing to help me track it down, if I spared them. I should see what they have to offer me."
"103224356-0-13290";"Before I can recover the <<z:1>> holding the villager's spirits from the Worm Cult, I must bring an offering to a nearby temple of Clavicus Vile, the Daedric Prince who cursed them. <<2>> will give me the key to the ruin."
"103224356-0-13291";"The Dres captive told me her leader used some kind of device to control the Dwarven constructs, but it was damaged. She also told me the raiders were preparing to attack the guards at the entrance to the ruins. I should stop them."
"103224356-0-13292";"I stopped the Dres raiders and should speak to Defender Maera at the main entrance to the ruins."
"103224356-0-13293";"I must talk to <<1>> to begin the Trial of the Fang. I can find him in the pit south of the pyramid."
"103224356-0-13296";"I should look for the assassins near slain Pact soldiers."
"103224356-0-13300";"Ulov claims a monster is killing people and copying their bodies. He trapped it inside the cellar of the Sathram Plantation stables. I should investigate."
"103224356-0-13301";"Tiril's double ran off. I must follow it."
"103224356-0-13302";"The entrance to the tomb is west of the city. I can reach the tomb entrance by going down the western pass out of town."
"103224356-0-13303";"The creature fled again. I must chase it before it copies Ruvali."
"103224356-0-13304";"Ruvali gave me Ra-shadda's idol. The Khajiit is the only one who might know how to deal with the monster. I must speak to him."
"103224356-0-13305";"Ra-shadda believes we can banish the dro-m'Athra using the Idol of the Hollow moon. To charge it, I must use the idol on the dark spirits of the plantation, then slay them to steal their power."
"103224356-0-13306";"I've drawn many spirits into the idol. If I can force the dro-m'Athra to possess me now, it will be destroyed.\n\nI must return to Ra-shadda. He waits in Ruvali's house."
"103224356-0-13307";"Ra-shadda asked that I finish charging the idol at an altar south of the stables."
"103224356-0-13308";"The dro-m'Athra stole Ulov's body. He ran out the back of the barn. I must chase after him and slay him."

"103224356-0-13311";"While I was talking to Ruvali Ulov entered the stables. It might not be him. I should use the idol on him to find out."
"103224356-0-13314";"Drinking the Hist sap put me into communion with the Hist. I've become an Argonian from long ago. My mind is filled with thoughts that aren't my own. I should explore Hissmir and see what the Hist wishes to tell me."
"103224356-0-13315";"To commune with the Hist, I must drink from the bowl of Hist sap near <<1>>."
"103224356-0-13316";"<<1>> suggested I ask <<2>>, the leader of Hissmir's Root Stewards, about Hist amber. He can be found on top of the xanmeer."
"103224356-0-13317";"<<1>> traveled to the ruins northwest of Hissmir, possibly looking for the Hist amber needed to activate Hissmir's defenses. I should confront him there."
"103224356-0-13318";"I recovered the Hist amber from <<1>>. I should use it to activate the Zaht stones in Hissmir to repel a Dominion attack."
"103224356-0-13319";"I need to leave the ruins and enter the fort. The exit from the ruins is down the hall, around the corner, and up the stairs from where I spoke to <<1>>."
"103224356-0-13321";"I've used all the healing potions I could recover from the Ashlander camps. <<1>> asked me to seek out <<2>> when I'm done."
"103224356-0-13324";"I must make an offering to Clavicus Vile at the <<z:1>> in <<2>>."
"103224356-0-13325";"Kagesh renegades took the tribe's medicinal herbs and alchemical healing draughts. Hedranna asked me to recover them and bring them to the temple. The crates are around Ashlander yurts. The draughts are carried by the Ashlanders themselves."
"103224356-0-13326";"I've recovered as much of the medicine as I can carry. <<1>> told me I should bring it to <<2>> within the temple grounds. She offers it to the Tribunal monks as a token of friendship."
"103224356-0-13327";"<<1>> thanked me for delivering the medicine. She'll attend to the crates of herbs, but she said there are soldiers throughout the temple who are near death. She asked me to take the alchemical draughts and use them on the worst cases."
"103224356-0-13329";"Once I find the Dominion treasure ship, I can board it and take their treasure."
"103224356-0-13330";"I've found the Dominion's treasure ship. Now I can board it and take their treasure. With that, and Tsanji's death, <<1>> will release <<2>>. The Dominion's trading in <<3>> will end."
"103224356-0-13331";"<<1>> is waiting for me to return to <<2>>. Supposedly, she has some important information I must hear. <<3>> said she would be waiting on the docks."
"103224356-0-13332";"<<1>> arrived to thank me for ending the Dominion's presence here."
"103224356-0-13333";"<<1>> told me the High Elf in charge of the Dominion in <<2>> was waiting for her in a cabin on the lower hold of her ship. If I want to end this supply running once and for all, I should kill her before she learns of One-Eye's treachery."
"103224356-0-13334";"<<1>> is dead. With luck, this means the end of supply running through <<2>>. That deals a severe blow to the Dominion's designs in Shadowfen. I should let <<3>> know the Dominion won't bother her town any longer."
"103224356-0-13357";"<<1>> explained that three strange healing fonts in the area will heal my skeletal form, as will healing magic. I should recover the <<z:2>> from the nearby Worm Cult camp while I remain a living skeleton."
"103224356-0-13358";"Saryvn asked me to find the key to his cage and an ancient Daedric tome. One of the Maulborn probably has the key, and he saw them carry the book into the lower tunnels."
"103224356-0-13359";"I have the key and the book. I need to speak to Saryvn back at his cage and decide what to do about his indiscretion."
"103224356-0-13360";"Saryvn has been freed and I agreed to cover for him. I should speak to his superior, Sergeant Maril."
"103224356-0-13361";"Saryvn has been freed, but I refused to lie for him. I should speak to his superior, Sergeant Maril."
"103224356-0-13362";"I should follow the directions in this note to learn what the rioters did next. I could start by following the note's directions to the area south of the barn."
"103224356-0-13363";"The Khajiit sent to free the prisoners must have been slain. Once the prisoners were freed, they were to meet up in the quarters east of the barn. I should go there and continue tracing their steps."
"103224356-0-13364";"A Khajiit named J'kur was the leader of this riot. He told the slaves to meet him in the pumpkin patch near the stables."
"103224356-0-13365";"<<1>> is planning some sort of necromantic ritual in the fort's keep. I should warn <<2>>."
"103224356-0-13366";"Our troops are pouring into the courtyard. I need to find where <<1>> is hiding. Walks-in-Ash thinks he might be in the keep."
"103224356-0-13373";"I've freed several of the Argonian slaves from the depths of Oblivion. I should tell Neposh the good news."
"103224356-0-13376";"I need to search Muth Gnaar to find <<1>>. Between the Ashlanders and the plague husks, his recklessness is going to get him hurt or killed."
"103224356-0-13377";"I defeated <<1>>. <<2>> is north of Muth Gnaar. I should tell him what happened."
"103224356-0-13378";"The crates filled with Llodos plague have been destroyed. I should return to the cave and speak to Naryu about our next move."

"103224356-0-13400";"I need to talk to <<1>> and find out what's happening in Kragenmoor."
"103224356-0-13401";"I have proof of the General's death. I should inform Captain Valec that he was slain by a Dremora imposter."
"103224356-0-13405";"I interrogated Ithis Omalor and learned that his superior, Magistrix Vox, sent him to attack the Hlaalu caravan. I agreed to grant him leniency. I should bring him to the Hlaalu caravaneers outside of Mzithumz."
"103224356-0-13406";"I should search the cart for clues and ask nearby pilgrims if they witnessed anything."
"103224356-0-13409";"I found a torn red jerkin outside a house in Hissmir. I should see if the relics are inside."
"103224356-0-13414";"I destroyed the wards. I should return to Scout Kanat before the plague spreads further."
"103224356-0-13415";"Hlaalu archers will try to destroy the cargo bound for Mournhold from the cliff above. I need to defend the archers while they make their attack. I'll meet up with Naryu Virian to signal the attack."
"103224356-0-13417";"Neposh's father, Last-to-Water, is apparently still trapped in Oblivion. Neposh fears that rescuing Last-to-Water will attract the attention of the Daedra Fatestealer. I should be ready to fight."
"103224356-0-13419";"The clues I've found point me to an Argonian in a red jerkin. Witnesses saw someone matching that description. Supposedly, he or she fled to the east. If the culprit is still here, I should search any dwellings or buildings in that area."
"103224356-0-13420";"Despite <<1>>'s misgivings, he gave me a key to Clavicus Vile's temple near <<2>>. Once I make an offering, I can safely recover the <<z:3>> from the Worm Cult."
"103224356-0-13423";"I should start searching for pilgrims on the road northeast of Hissmir."
"103224356-0-13425";"I found the bodies of some of the missing pilgrims. I should continue my search."
"103224356-0-13426";"I found another victim at the base of a small cliff. It looks like she was killed recently, then dropped. I should check the cliffs above her body."
"103224356-0-13431";"I need to challenge and defeat the Redoran Sentinels. If I can show the fort they can be beaten, their power should fade dramatically."
"103224356-0-13432";"I need to speak to Commander Taldyn in the training yard to determine what to do about the Sentinels."
"103224356-0-13434";"I destroyed the <<z:1>>, ending the villagers' bargain with Clavicus Vile. I should return to <<2>> and see what became of the villagers."

"103224356-0-13452";"Now that I've freed the guards from the animus geodes, I should look for <<1>> on the hill near <<2>>."
"103224356-0-13465";"I agreed to free the spirits of <<1>>'s slain guards. They're trapped in ""animus geodes"" around the necromancers' camp."
"103224356-0-13466";"I need to decide not only Raston's fate, but the fate of the Mabrigash as well. I should talk to tribe members and the merchant's assistant before I inform the Farseer of my decision."
"103224356-0-13467";"Speak to Raston's apprentice or some of the Mabrigash to get advice and gather opinions before making a decision."
"103224356-0-13469";"A scout of the Kagesh tribe met me as I passed Iliath Temple. He explained the situation and asked me to meet the wise woman of his tribe. She's at her encampment east of the temple."
"103224356-0-13470";"I need to collect six wasp gizzards. That's the basis for Churasu's concoction."
"103224356-0-13471";"I have the gizzards I need to make the concoction. I need to go to Churasu's hut by the shore. Then I can use her alchemy journal and supplies to make the mixture."
"103224356-0-13472";"I spread the mixture around and attracted a lot of angry wasps. They went right after the Khajiiti pirates. I should return to Churasu and let her know what happened."
"103224356-0-13473";"Success! The mixture worked! Now I need to splash the concoction on the tree outside."
"103224356-0-13477";"Drillk declared me the captain of his royal army. Now that he has addressed his ""subjects,"" I should speak to Drillk about the keystone."
"103224356-0-13478";"Drillk is dead. He gave his life to pass the keystone to me. I should return to <<1>> and let her know about the keystone."
"103224356-0-13479";"I awakened Ayleid pilasters in the Temple of Sul. They revealed what seemed to be memories of the past. I should report what I've learned to Neeja-Meen in Hissmir."
"103224356-0-13480";"Churasu said there would be an alchemy journal in the hut. I should be able to determine the recipe."
"103224356-0-13482";"<<1>> is a bit unstable. He's tasked me with constructing a crown for him. After I indulge him, he'll lead me to the keystone. I can scavenge metal from crates around the village and broken glass from the grounds."
"103224356-0-13483";"I should take the metal and bits of glass to the anvil north of <<1>>. Then I can shape them into a crown."
"103224356-0-13484";"I've finished forging a crown. I should take it to <<1>>."
"103224356-0-13485";"<<1>> asked me to free Zuuk subjects captured by the invaders. I took a Scroll of Release that should unlock the binding spell that ensnares them."
"103224356-0-13486";"I made an incorrect calculation on the amount of materials I required. I need to collect another gizzard to make up for the lost one."
"103224356-0-13487";"Drillk said the word ""betrux"" will remove the ward that blocks the Temple of Sul. Doing so will allow entrance into the temple."
"103224356-0-13488";"I've entered the Temple of Sul. Now I need to locate and obtain the keystone."
"103224356-0-13489";"I've unlocked the keystone's chamber. I should take the keystone and leave."

"103224356-0-14322";"I've found Pash-Riha. I should speak to her."
"103224356-0-14323";"Pash-Riha, Elder Seven-Bellies' sister, chased after the Covenant soldier who led the attack. I promised Seven-Bellies I'd look for her. He said she ran to the northwest, seeking blood."
"103224356-0-14324";"I've been instructed to speak to the Elder of Lukiul Uxith, Seven-Bellies. He'll know more about the Covenant's activities in the area."
"103224356-0-14326";"<<1>> needs my help with some sort of divination ritual. A portion of the <<z:2>> needs to be placed at each of the steles surrounding the xanmeer, an ancient ziggurat."
"103224356-0-14328";"I should meet <<1>> atop its ancient stone temple. He should be able to begin his ritual now."
"103224356-0-14333";"I should speak to <<1>> and learn more about the situation at Muth Gnaar."
"103224356-0-14334";"I should ask <<1>> whether his ritual revealed the source of Xal Ithix's problems."
"103224356-0-14336";"I need to look for a Daedric relic buried at the base of an ancient stele near Xal Ithix's Hist tree, west of the xanmeer."
"103224356-0-14337";"I should speak with the Kothringi held in Zuuk to see if he can help me find the keystone."

"103224356-0-14340";"I should search the occupied village of <<1>> for the missing Shadowscale agents: <<2>>, <<3>>, and <<4>>."

"103224356-0-14343";"Now that I've retrived the Relleis Lor keystone, I should find <<1>>.\n\nHe's waiting for me at an excavation site in Murkwater."
"103224356-0-14345";"<<1>> asked me to kill the Dominion leaders, and to collect crystallized fire salts from the Dominion ship. Once I have the fire salts, I'll spread them on the river to destory the Dominion's lifeline, their ship."
"103224356-0-14350";"Now that I've rescued the Shadowscale agents, I should meet their leader, <<1>>, at the rendezvous. <<2>> said it's on a hill at southwest edge of <<3>>."
"103224356-0-14351";"I made the necessary cultural exchanges. I should bring the Dunmer book, relic, and clothing back to Rigurt the Brash."
"103224356-0-14352";"I can find the items Rigurt wants in Muth Gnaar, Shad Astula, and the crafting district in Mournhold. I may have to convince the Dark Elves to trade, however, as they probably aren't aware of this Nord tradition."
"103224356-0-14358";"I experienced memories of Vox's past and somehow she sensed my presence. I should speak to Aspera about this."
"103224356-0-14359";"I need to find and speak to <<1>>."
"103224356-0-14360";"I couldn't let Drillk die on my behalf. The keystone will be safe within him. I should return to <<1>> and let her know about the keystone."
"103224356-0-14361";"When I retrieved the artifact, <<1>>, the shadowy figure of a Dremora appeared. I better talk to it."
"103224356-0-14362";"<<1>> said I should take the relic to a ritual site high above Xal Ithix. The relic may somehow stop Namira's minions from whatever corruption they're performing."
"103224356-0-14365";"<<1>> told me I could use the Hand of Namira to defeat the Dremora. I need to use it to stop the Aspect's ritual and keep corruption from consuming Xal Ithix."
"103224356-0-14368";"Aspera wants me to experience Vox's memories so that I can learn what brought us to this moment. I need to find the western anima archive to see the earliest memory."
"103224356-0-14369";"I should attune myself to the anima crystal to observe Vox's earliest memory. Once within the memory, I should speak to Aspera's projection."

"103224356-0-14399";"Ulov is standing near the trapdoor in Ruvali's house. I should ask him if he's seen Ruvali."
"103224356-0-14401";"The mercenaries have been cured and they fled Zehtswater Cave. I should go outside and find <<1>>."
"103224356-0-14402";"I need to collect venom from the giant serpents within Zehtswater Cave. Then I need to combine the venom with the Antivenom Kit to create antidotes to the Lamia poison. With the antidote, I can rescue the mercenaries."
"103224356-0-14403";"An Ordinator informed me that Almalexia wants to see me at the Temple."
"103224356-0-14404";"Daedra have invaded the Tribunal Temple. I need to destroy them and close the portals that spawn them."
"103224356-0-14405";"Almalexia informed me invaders still hold the High Chapel. The combined powers of the Tribunal protect the area from mortal entry. To enter the High Chapel, I need to attain the blessings of Vivec and Sotha Sil at each of their altars."
"103224356-0-14406";"I prayed at Almalexia's altar and now I should speak with her."
"103224356-0-14407";"In order to receive Vivec's blessing, I need to pass his trial. I should speak with Almalexia to ask for advice."
"103224356-0-14410";"I need to find a way to repair the Arbiter of Perfection, and then I need to destroy it. When I'm done, I should receive the blessing of Sotha Sil."
"103224356-0-14411";"I received Vivec's blessing. Now I should go to Sotha Sil's cloister and pray at the altar to start his trial."
"103224356-0-14412";"I received Sotha Sil's blessing. Now I should go to Vivec's cloister and pray at the altar to start his trial."
"103224356-0-14417";"I received the three blessings of the Tribunal. Now I should enter the High Chapel and hunt down the leader of this invasion force."
"103224356-0-14418";"I found a Maulborn high priest in the High Chapel of the Tribunal Temple. He must pay for his crimes."
"103224356-0-14419";"I defeated Vanus Sathram and saved the Tribunal Temple, but Vox escaped with the Judgment of Veloth. I should tell Almalexia what happened."
"103224356-0-14423";"I need to return to the mortuary, so I can speak to <<1>>."
"103224356-0-14432";"Vox weakened Saint Veloth by shattering his reliquary. I need to recover the pieces, scattered around the shrine, and bring them to Master Aron."
"103224356-0-14437";"The reliquary can now be reassembled and Saint Veloth's powers can be restored. I must go back to the top of the shrine and repair the reliquary."
"103224356-0-14438";"The reliquary is whole again. I can see that Saint Veloth's spirit has also recovered. I should speak to him."
"103224356-0-14439";"I restored the Shrine of Saint Veloth and received his blessing. It's time to face Magistrix Vox at Eidolon's Hollow."
"103224356-0-14442";"I met Acolyte Eldri at the Shrine of Saint Veloth. She collected Dremora hearts for Healer Dalen, who makes strong healing potions from them. I should find Healer Dalen at Eidolon's Hollow and give him the hearts."

"103224356-0-14445";"I need to find Elynisi Arthalen on the road to Selfora."
"103224356-0-14453";"The ritual preparation is complete. Talk to <<1>> and begin the final phase of the ritual."
"103224356-0-14454";"I should use the ritual braziers to summon the guardians. Then I can open the portal into <<1>>."
"103224356-0-14455";"<<1>> asked me to enter the mine and save some trapped miners, but she wasn't concerned about <<2>>.\n\nShe gave me food scraps to throw at and distract hungry Goblins I might find in the mine."
"103224356-0-14457";"<<1>> said I need to get the Goblin totem. Then I can stop the Goblins from attacking and help him free them from slavery. The Goblin war chief has the totem. He's in the camp above the mine."
"103224356-0-14458";"Now that I have the totem, I should give it to <<1>> or <<2>>. They're both waiting in the Mud Tree Village mine."
"103224356-0-14461";"I gave the <<1>> to <<2>>. He can use it to lead the Goblins to freedom. I should speak to his brothers in <<3>> and let them know what happened."
"103224356-0-14462";"I collected several pieces of Saint Veloth's Reliquary. I should find Master Aron at the top of the shrine and give the pieces to him."
"103224356-0-14464";"Before I can seal the wispmother, I must defeat her from within the cave."
"103224356-0-14465";"I've defeated the wispmother, but if she reforms, I'll need to slay her again to seal her remains."
"103224356-0-14466";"I need to collect bog rats to use as an offering to Ghost Snake with the bag that I've been given. They can be found in Ghost Snake Vale."
"103224356-0-14467";"My final trial is to defeat the Shadow Snake, a more sinister aspect of the Ghost Snake."
"103224356-0-14468";"I have the offering. Now I need to place it in the offering bowl at the Fang Spires and see what happens."
"103224356-0-14469";"I defeated the Shadow Snake. I'll seek the Ghost Snake's counsel on the issue of trade between the Mabrigash and House Hlaalu."
"103224356-0-14470";"I walked the Coiled Path and made an offering to the Ghost Snake. It appeared before me. I should speak to it."
"103224356-0-14472";"I need to lower the wards at the entrance to the Tormented Spire."
"103224356-0-14473";"With the wards down, I can enter the spire and begin the long climb to the top."
"103224356-0-14474";"Walks-in-Ash managed to sneak onto the spire after Tanval. She and her troops were cut off when the wards went back up. I need to find her and learn what I can about Tanval's plan."
"103224356-0-14475";"Walks-in-Ash told me about a series of ancient wards that still block our path up the mountainside. Each one is beneath a Daedric ruin, and each one must be lowered before the Pact soldiers can reach the top."
"103224356-0-14476";"I've found the first ward on the approach to the spire. We'll need to lower it before we can continue."
"103224356-0-14478";"I must lower the next ward on the approach to the spire."
"103224356-0-14479";"The northern pagoda leads to an underground room, which holds the crystal powering the second ward. I can use the House Dres key to enter the room and disable the ward."
"103224356-0-14480";"I need to remove the crystal powering the second ward from the ruins beneath the northern pagoda."
"103224356-0-14482";"Holgunn and Walks-in-Ash have taken most of the Tormented Spire. I should find them near the volcano's caldera."
"103224356-0-14483";"I've found Tanval. I should ask him why he's injured."
"103224356-0-14484";"The caldera ruins contain the final ward preventing us from confronting the Brother of Strife."
"103224356-0-14485";"One ward stands between the Pact and the second Brother of Strife."
"103224356-0-14487";"The final ward has been lowered. We should be able to enter the prison holding the second Brother of Strife."
"103224356-0-14488";"The Dominion's forces have been routed. <<1>>'s ritual was a success. The Argonian spirits of the forsaken hamlet can now return to the restored Hist tree. They can be at peace."
"103224356-0-14489";"With the Dominion's leader dead, perhaps <<1>> can find some peace."
"103224356-0-14490";"I escorted Elynisi safely to the inn. She's speaking to someone named Meldras. I should wait until they finish their conversation."
"103224356-0-14499";"The door ahead leads to Vox's Hollow. I should look for her there."
"103224356-0-14500";"Vox draws upon the souls at the center of the Hollow. I should speak to her and provoke her into striking me with Veloth's hammer."
"103224356-0-14501";"I've been transported to Vox's spirit realm, but the Blessing of Veloth protects me. My memories are still clear and my body is still whole. I should speak to the spirits here to learn more."
"103224356-0-14512";"The key to lowering the final ward keeping us from Sadal lies in the grasp of a powerful Daedra. I must slay her and claim the key."
"103224356-0-14513";"I've burnt the Dominion ships and retrieved the Relleis Lor keystone, I should return to <<1>> in Murkwater."
"103224356-0-14514";"I can use the summoning bowl on the spire to summon Flamespinner."
"103224356-0-14516";"Tanval said the first spirit is waiting for me on the platform in the center of the caldera."
"103224356-0-14517";"The spirit of Arch-Mage <<1>> informed me that three Focus Stones are required to open Sadal's prison. The first Focus Stone is on the south side of the caldera. I must cross a pit of molten lava to reach it."
"103224356-0-14518";"I have the first Focus Stone. I must return it to <<1>>."
"103224356-0-14519";"<<1>> said another trial awaits me. I must speak to his colleague at the top of the stairs leading into the caldera."
"103224356-0-14520";"Powerful spells are honed by trial and error. <<1>> wants me to prove my patience by retrieving a Focus Stone from the back of the cave. She said I must follow the spells they took to contain Sadal."
"103224356-0-14521";"I have the second Focus Stone. I must return to <<1>>."
"103224356-0-14522";"I must complete one final trial. I'll find the third spirit near a cave above the caldera."
"103224356-0-14523";"Mavos has charged me with retrieving the final Focus Crystal. To do this, I must understand the ebb and flow of magic and be precise in my movements."
"103224356-0-14524";"I have the final Focus Stone. I must return to <<1>>."
"103224356-0-14525";"The spirit magi have agreed to help me. I need to place the three Focus Stones in the center of the caldera."
"103224356-0-14526";"I've placed the Focus Stones as instructed. I'll finally be allowed access to Sadal's prison."
"103224356-0-14527";"The spirits have opened a portal into Sadal's prison. At last, we can enter his realm and rebind him within the spire."
"103224356-0-14528";"The Keeper has trapped several spirits within this realm. I should talk to the spirits and figure out how to set them free."
"103224356-0-14530";"With the other spirits free, I need to convince Meram to join me. Perhaps by sharing the knowledge I learned with him, he'll regret his actions and join me."
"103224356-0-14533";"The portal to the Reservoir of Souls stands open. I need to enter it and confront Vox."
"103224356-0-14534";"I must fight through Vox's minions. Then I can confront Vox and end this."
"103224356-0-14535";"Vox is dead. Almalexia recovered the hammer. I should speak to her."
"103224356-0-14536";"Almalexia informed me that the Maulborn unleashed Daedra into the Tribunal Temple. I should enter the Temple and banish the Daedric invaders."
"103224356-0-14539";"Advisor Varon suggested I seek the assistance of a group of villagers who decided to find the missing people on their own. Slips-Through-Fingers, an Argonian, is apparently connected to the group."
"103224356-0-14550";"I gathered everything I could. I should return to <<1>>."
"103224356-0-14551";"I should speak with the Enigma of Sotha Sil to receive its blessing."
"103224356-0-14552";"I should speak with the Enigma of Vivec to receive its blessing."
"103224356-0-14556";"I need to find a way into <<1>>."
"103224356-0-14557";"The Imperial translation journal implies that they seek to create and control Dwarven constructs designed by the ancient Dwarven master Razak. They cannot, however, find the three keys to open the door to his vault."
"103224356-0-14558";"I've found all three keys to Razak's vault. I should open the vault."
"103224356-0-14559";"Razak's Vault is open! I should investigate the unsealed chamber."
"103224356-0-14560";"I've found the cog mold. The Dwemer Journal included a map of the Wheel that emphasized a room to the south. I should take the mold to that chamber."
"103224356-0-14562";"I should locate Razak's Machine and install the cog to see what happens."
"103224356-0-14563";"Razak's Machine has spit out a strange Dwarven spider construct. It appears to be waiting for something."
"103224356-0-14564";"I have made it inside <<1>> and must now search for evidence as to why the Imperials are here."
"103224356-0-14568";"The Dwemer contraption formed a cog for me, destroying the mold in the process. I should retrieve the completed cog."
"103224356-0-14571";"The Dominion spy using Saervild's form is dead. Now that I've collected the relics, I should take them back to <<1>>."
"103224356-0-14581";"Once these medical supplies get to the tower above the overrun camp, I can find out where the keystone is kept."
"103224356-0-14582";"I need to speak with <<1>> and tell him about the Keystone."
"103224356-0-14585";"I've buried the remains, which brought <<1>> to the tree. I should speak with her before she passes on."
"103224356-0-14587";"<<1>> is in a dilapidated building within the prison grounds."
"103224356-0-14588";"I've retrieved Najeepa's remains from <<1>>. I should bring them to her spirit, so she can finally rest."
"103224356-0-14591";"I should search the prison towers for any signs of Bezeer's mother. Her spirit has not yet left. I should be able to identify her remains."
"103224356-0-14592";"I found the spirit of Bezeer's mother. She told me where her remains are. I should go to the tower within the prison and retrieve whatever is left of her remains."
"103224356-0-14593";"It appears I'm in a vision of the past. I should speak to the Ebonheart Acolyte near me to find out what's happening here."
"103224356-0-14594";"In the Ash Mountain of the past, Balreth summoned Daedric portals. The acolyte I spoke to gave me a pouch of silver stones. Throwing these into the portals will close them."
"103224356-0-14595";"Before any of the prisoners can tell me where the keystone is, I need to retrieve medical supplies from an overrun camp on the north side of the prison."
"103224356-0-14596";"<<1>> has requested that I find and kill the Imperial commander, <<2>>, and recover her lost orders from <<3>>."
"103224356-0-14597";"<<1>> is dead and <<2>>'s orders retrieved. I should find and inform <<2>>."
"103224356-0-14598";"I've freed <<1>> from her bonds. I should speak to her."
"103224356-0-14599";"Now that I've summoned the guardians, I should wait for them to open the portal into Ash Mountain."
"103224356-0-14600";"I should enter the prison dungeon and locate the keystone."
"103224356-0-14601";"I need to find <<1>>, a prisoner who entered the dungeon while foraging for supplies."
"103224356-0-14602";"<<1>> believes the keystone is located within the prison warden's office, which will be in the structure above the cells. We'll need to find our way up there."
"103224356-0-14603";"I must make a choice: I can absorb the keystone or release the prisoners."
"103224356-0-14604";"The power released from the keystone has riled up the cannibals. I need to kill them and survive."
"103224356-0-14605";"I chose to absorb the keystone instead of using it to free the prisoners. <<1>> was driven mad. I must escape the prison and let <<2>> know."
"103224356-0-14606";"<<1>> fled from the prison after I killed <<2>>. I should meet him outside the prison walls."
"103224356-0-14608";"<<1>> must still be somewhere within the prison grounds. I need to locate him and tell him what happened to the keystone."
"103224356-0-14611";"Acolyte Hlen saw the daedroth carry Saint Veloth's Skull into the nearby crypt. I must enter the crypt to recover the holy relic."
"103224356-0-14612";"Selfora is safe now. I should return to the inn and tell Elynisi about her father."
"103224356-0-14613";"Elynisi asked me to search the Selfora town hall to find her father, Tidyn. She gave me a key to unlock the building."
"103224356-0-14614";"I'm in the town hall. Now I should search for Tidyn Arthalen."
"103224356-0-14615";"The Forlorn One appeared over the body of Tidyn Arthalen. I should speak to the spirit and find out what happened here."
"103224356-0-14616";"The Forlorn One is actually the spirit of Tidyn Arthalen. He was slain by Magistrix Vox and chained to Selfora by her echo. He wants me to go to the crater in the middle of Selfora, where he'll summon Vox's echo."
"103224356-0-14617";"The spirit of Tidyn Arthalen summoned the Echo of Vox to the crater at the center of Selfora. I need to subdue the Echo of Vox and capture it by using the decanter."
"103224356-0-14618";"I defeated and captured the Echo of Vox. It's trapped in the decanter and the curse on Selfora has lifted. Now that this is finished, I should speak to Tidyn."
"103224356-0-14622";"<<1>> wants to speak with me before I do anything with the keystone."
"103224356-0-14639";"Vox is dead. Almalexia recovered the hammer. I should speak to her."
"103224356-0-14646";"I should find Healer Dalen at Eidolon's Hollow and give him the Dremora hearts that Acolyte Eldri collected."
"103224356-0-14647";"Now that I saved Dithis, I should return to the other mages and give them the good news."
"103224356-0-14651";"The tree-minder's missing items may be my first clue to solving the mystery. I need to find the broken staff, pages from her book, and the lost key.\n\nI'll head through the tunnel to search for the items in what lies beyond it."
"103224356-0-14652";"Garyn asked me to journey to Othrenis and find <<1>>. He may need help."
"103224356-0-14653";"The tree-minder's ghost appeared, hovering over the last object I recovered. I need to talk to this spirit."
"103224356-0-14654";"I should report what I've discovered to Sees-All-Colors."
"103224356-0-14656";"<<1>> believes we can use the spirits of the Argonians to revive the Hist tree. I need to use her staff's headpiece to capture some. I'll subdue some spirits and meet her at the tree."
"103224356-0-14659";"Now that I've subdued some of the hamlet's tormented spirits, I need to take the headpiece to <<1>> at the Hist tree. I'll talk to her once I get there. Perhaps I may come closer to solving this mystery and ending the spirits' torment."
"103224356-0-14660";"I should find <<1>> in the Fighters Guild. I need to give him the Ayleid tome and the Prismatic Core recovered within the <<2>> ruins."
"103224356-0-14667";"I found the three keys. Now I need to find the three chests somewhere in the camp."
"103224356-0-14668";"To imprison Balreth, I must gain control of the guardians at Ash Mountain. To summon the guardians, Garyn wants me to harvest the hearts of lesser Daedra."
"103224356-0-14675";"The portal stands open. The spirit of <<1>> has appeared once more at the portal entrance. I should speak to him to see if he has any advice for defeating Balreth."
"103224356-0-14676";"<<1>> believes we can use the spirits of the Argonians to revive the Hist tree. I need to use her staff's headpiece to capture them. The headpiece came from the tree."
"103224356-0-14677";"Having returned the broken headpiece to the tree-minder, I need to wait and see if she is able to restore the Hist tree … or at least put her fellow spirits to rest. I'll talk to her when she's finished."
"103224356-0-14678";"The Dominion is boiling the stolen Hist sap, tormenting the spirits. I need to burn the Dominion's containers of Hist sap to ruin the contents."
"103224356-0-14680";"I've retrieved the <<1>> from Hectur. I should bring it to <<2>>."
"103224356-0-14682";"If I'm to procure a bottle of <<1>>, I'll need to swap the real bottle with the fake bottle given to me by Heleran."
"103224356-0-14686";"The Hist sap is free of the Dominion's refinement containers, so the Argonian spirits should be calm again, but the Dominion's soldiers know where I came from. I must return to the Hist tree and confer with <<1>>."
"103224356-0-14687";"I've freed the prisoners by destroying the keystone. I should speak with <<1>>."
"103224356-0-14688";"The tree-minder believes that with the Hist sap freed, she may be able to perform a ritual that will either restore the tree or create a new sapling in its place. She needs me to make certain the Dominion doesn't stop her."
"103224356-0-14689";"While fighting <<1>>, I can use <<2>> to stun him. <<3>>'s aura will restore me if I'm exhausted."
"103224356-0-14698";"I'm supposed to meet with Merric and Aelif, top lieutenants in the Fighters Guild. They're investigating a Coldharbour anchor near the city."
"103224356-0-14703";"I need to protect the hamlet's spirits from Dominion forces. If they destroy the spirits, <<1>>'s ritual will lose its power, and the Hist tree won't be restored. If I fail, the hamlet will remain haunted forever."
"103224356-0-14704";"He suggested I find the mine foreman, <<1>>. I need more information."
"103224356-0-14705";"I've retrieved the <<1>> from Fedrasa at the Ebony Flask. I should return it to <<2>>."
"103224356-0-14707";"If I'm to procure a bottle of <<1>>, I'll need to swap the real bottle with the fake bottle Heleran gave me."
"103224356-0-14710";"My spider collected the parts Kireth needs to repair the emitter. I should find Kireth and give the parts to her."
"103224356-0-14711";"Kireth entered the ruins without her brother, who was injured trying to follow her. He invented a control rod to deal with the constructs inside. I need to take it to his sister."
"103224356-0-14712";"Kireth wants me to create a diversion so she can sneak through the next chamber. She suggested I use her brother's control rod to capture a Dwarven spider. She thinks it might take a few attempts."
"103224356-0-14713";"Kireth needs spare parts to repair the Dwarven device. Since Dwarven constructs scavenge parts from broken automata, I need to break a few spiders. Then I can use the control rod to direct my follower to gather the parts."
"103224356-0-14714";"The guardians have appeared. Now I must force them to do their duty and imprison Balreth."
"103224356-0-14715";"I cleared the way out of the mine. I need to get proof from <<1>> before I allow him to leave."
"103224356-0-14717";"<<1>> has arrived. He helped me imprison Balreth, a Brother of Strife, forever. I should speak to him and see if anything else remains to be done."
"103224356-0-14723";"I've slain all three of the vicious creatures plaguing the wilderness of <<1>>. I should return to <<2>> and collect the rewards she mentioned."
"103224356-0-14730";"I gathered the goods from the locked chests, but they turned out to be nothing more than trinkets. Valuable, but hardly dangerous.\n\nI should return to Kotholl and find out what's going on."
"103224356-0-14731";"Kotholl wanted to steal the goods to make up for lost pay so that he could feed his family. I told him to return the goods anyway."
"103224356-0-14732";"<<1>> thinks burning <<2>>'s banner is the best way to get his attention. I agreed to do it. If I fight him one-on-one, his heart will be in my hands in no time."
"103224356-0-14737";"I need to find her children's remains somewhere in White Rose Prison's dungeon."
"103224356-0-14744";"I have <<1>>'s heart, as <<2>> requested. I need to find him at the swamp's edge below the Dominion's southeastern camp."
"103224356-0-14745";"I should find out what Orona plans to do with the kwama cuttle before I turn it over to her."
"103224356-0-14747";"Balreth's body has been defeated, and his spirit is trapped inside the Daedric ritual circle! I must summon the guardians of Ash Mountain to contain him once and for all."
"103224356-0-14748";"Now that I have <<1>> and her children's remains, I should take them to the tree she mentioned. It's in the northwest corner of the prison not far from its cave entrance."
"103224356-0-14753";"Merric and Aelif were ambushed by Daedra! I should help Aelif fend off the attack."
"103224356-0-14756";"I must use the open portal at Tormented Spire to enter Sadal's prison."
"103224356-0-14766";"I've entered Sadal's prison—a strange, volcanic realm somewhere in Oblivion. I must help Tanval, Holgunn, and Walks-in-Ash defeat Sadal."
"103224356-0-14767";"With Tanval's sacrifice, we've destroyed Sadal's shell. I must summon the guardians of the Tormented Spire before Sadal recovers."
"103224356-0-14768";"The guardians approach. I must wait until they imprison Sadal's soul forever in Oblivion."
"103224356-0-14769";"Sadal is defeated. He's imprisoned forever. It's time to return to Tamriel."
"103224356-0-14770";"We have safely returned to Tamriel. I should speak with Walks-in-Ash."
"103224356-0-14771";"Tanval's spirit has appeared outside the Tormented Spire. I may be the only one who can see him. I should see what he has to say."
"103224356-0-14772";"Tanval's spirit is at peace, and Stonefalls is safe. I should give <<1>> the news about his new position as interim leader of the Pact in Stonefalls."
"103224356-0-14793";"After a number of attempts, I finally got one of the Dwarven spiders to follow me around like some kind of pet. So that's what the control rod does! I should find Kireth Vanos in the next chamber and show her."
"103224356-0-14795";"Edrasa Drelas asked me to gather plants so she could make a potion to counter the effects of the fumes. She can use either redweed or aloe leaves."
"103224356-0-14796";"I gathered the ingredients Edrasa requested. I should take them to her so she can make more of the potion."
"103224356-0-14797";"Edrasa asked me to bring the potion to her husband, Boril. He went back into the mine to help his workers."
"103224356-0-14798";"The Dwarven spider following me was destroyed. I need to use the control rod to get another one."
"103224356-0-14802";"Part 1 is to talk to QAT Talking Interactable"
"103224356-0-14803";"Return to the QA Quest Interactable"
"103224356-0-14804";"You must talk to the QAT Conversationalist to advance this quest."
"103224356-0-14805";"The Dwarven Spider following me was destroyed. I need to use the control rod to get another one."
"103224356-0-14808";"<<1>> intends to take the transformed Dithis as his Goblin matron. I must defeat the warlord to save this unfortunate event."
"103224356-0-14812";"I should take Merric back to Sees-All-Colors."
"103224356-0-14813";"I recovered a broken Dwarven relic from the locked chest. Kireth Vanos will want to see this."
"103224356-0-14814";"I should adjust the prisms until they work in some way that makes sense."
"103224356-0-14815";"I found a large chest and a Dwarven spider in the room beyond the huge door. Perhaps the spider has the key I need to open the chest."
"103224356-0-14816";"I directed the beam of light until it struck a prism set above the huge door. I heard a loud click, as though a large lock disengaged. I should open the door."
"103224356-0-14841";"Cultists and various creatures loyal to Vox lurk in the ruins of Eidolon's Hollow. I need to kill as many as I can to help out the Ordinators."
"103224356-0-14842";"I killed a number of Vox's troops. When I get the chance, I should report to Ordinator Gorili outside the ruins or to Ordinator Eron in Mournhold and let them know what I accomplished."
"103224356-0-14843";"I killed a number of Vox's troops. When I get the chance, I should report to Ordinator Gorili outside the ruins or to Ordinator Eron in Mournhold and let them know what I accomplished."
"103224356-0-14844";"I killed a number of Vox's troops. When I get the chance, I should report to Ordinator Gorili outside the ruins or to Ordinator Eron in Mournhold and let them know what I accomplished."
"103224356-0-14851";"I defeated the giant spider and found a key. I should see if the key opens the ornate Dwarven chest at the back of the chamber."
"103224356-0-14853";"A dead man appeared as I came close to the island, and called out to me. I should speak with it."
"103224356-0-14855";"I must enter the dungeon beneath the tower to save Merric."
"103224356-0-14856";"An Ashlander named <<1>> seeks the death of three fearsome creatures: a clannfear named <<2>>, a netch named <<3>>, and a nix hound named <<4>>. These creatures have killed many people in recent months."
"103224356-0-14858";"I survived the dangers presented by the Argonian spirits trapped in torment, and I reached <<1>>'s hut. I need to speak to the spirit that inhabits it now."
"103224356-0-14859";"I recovered a broken Dwarven relic from the locked chest. Kireth Vanos will want to see this."
"103224356-0-14871";"I found J'kur's body. He was holding a note and a map. The note was intended for someone named Vahara. The map points at an area north of the plantation. I should go there and look for Vahara."
"103224356-0-14877";"I've killed the Dominion leaders and collected the fire salts. Now I should spread the fire salts around the river. I can toss the salts from the river shore."
"103224356-0-14881";"I should talk to Sees-All-Colors once more about the forging of the weapon and the events at the Earth Forge."
"103224356-0-14882";"<<1>> summoned the <<2>>, but it killed him. He never gave me the reward he promised, but if I decide to search his bag, he's in no position to object"
"103224356-0-14883";"There must be someone in <<1>> who can identify this figure."
"103224356-0-14884";"<<1>> promised me a huge reward for bringing him the fetish. He's eager to use his new prize, and he asked me to wait."
"103224356-0-14885";"I purchased the statue from <<1>>. He might know something about where it came from."
"103224356-0-14887";"I was told a Dark Elf named <<1>> was recently in the area searching for a statue. He's currently searching the Daedric ruins on the plateau south of <<2>>, overlooking <<3>>."
"103224356-0-14888";"<<1>> said his people occasionally find these statues buried in the Ashlands. He insisted that he didn't know their purpose. He suggested I speak with a priest of the tribunal at Kragenmoor."
"103224356-0-14896";"The puzzle stones are now something called a Hist key. Keys unlock things, but what lies behind the lock? I need to talk to Looks to find out more."
"103224356-0-14897";"<<1>> succumbed to the enchantment of the Fangs of Sithis, but he repented as he was dying. More importantly, I've recovered only one Fang. The other is gone. I must tell <<2>>."
"103224356-0-14898";"I chose to keep the Fangs of Sithis and the decision stuck. I should talk to <<1>> and see what he thinks."
"103224356-0-14900";"One of the researchers, <<1>>, has been watching the pirates. He may have useful information."
"103224356-0-14901";"<<1>> knows more about these ancient ruins. Talking to him could help me decide whether to help them."
"103224356-0-14902";"The pirates have stumbled on the key to a great treasure, but they don't know it yet. I need to recover something called a <<z:1>>. I can use it to find another piece of the puzzle."
"103224356-0-14903";"The green puzzle stone can lead me to the next clue, but I have to be careful. The pirates camped here might be drunk, but they aren't blind."
"103224356-0-14914";"The pirates have definitely found the clues to entering the Argonian xanmeer, but haven't put them together yet. I need to find the next puzzle stone."
"103224356-0-14915";"At least one pirate thought the <<z:1>> was important enough to lock up. I should use the stone to find the last of the three."
"103224356-0-14916";"Another stone was hidden away by the pirates. I need to find the <<1>>."
"103224356-0-14918";"Merric was taken to a tower on an island nearby. I should go to this island in search of Merric."
"103224356-0-14919";"Merric asked me to search the bodies of the Worm Cultists who attacked him."
"103224356-0-14921";"That's the last of them. I'd best watch my step, or I'll draw the pirates' attention."
"103224356-0-14922";"Now that I've reported in to Sees-All-Colors, she wants me to join Aelif. To keep Merric safe. I should make my way to them at once."
"103224356-0-14924";"The last wisp floated up the xanmeer's stone steps. I should climb to the top and see what's there."
"103224356-0-14929";"I need to see if the Argonian on top of the xanmeer knows about the puzzle stones and how they relate to the xanmeer."
"103224356-0-14930";"Elynisi has asked me to go to the temple on the hill to look for survivors. I can reach the temple by taking the stairs to the south and crossing the bridge."
"103224356-0-14931";"A spirit called the Forlorn One has materialized at the temple's entrance. It appears to want to speak with me."
"103224356-0-14932";"The Forlorn One asked me to find a decanter of holy water on the lower level of the temple. The water has the power to quench the magical fire consuming Selfora."
"103224356-0-14934";"Now that I have the decanter of holy water, I should speak to the Forlorn One at the temple's entrance."
"103224356-0-14936";"The Forlorn One has summoned a vision of the past. I should watch and learn what happened to Selfora."
"103224356-0-14937";"I should test the potency of the holy water on the brazier of magic fire in the center of the temple's lower chamber."
"103224356-0-14938";"The Forlorn One shared a vision of the past with me. I should ask him about it."
"103224356-0-14939";"Now that Elynisi is safely in the inn, I should talk to her and see what she wants me to do next."
"103224356-0-14940";"I completed the memory challenge. I should speak to Arch-Mage Valeyn to find out what he wants me to do next."
"103224356-0-14946";"<<1>> asked me to retrieve several valuable scrolls that should have survived the fires. He also wants me to find his fellow devotees: <<2>>, <<3>>, and <<4>>."
"103224356-0-14947";"I've rescued the three devotees and recovered the scrolls. I should return to <<1>>."
"103224356-0-14948";"I need to search the burning homes in the southern part of Selfora for the two people the Forlorn One mentioned. The holy water should put out the fire blocking the doors so that I can enter them."
"103224356-0-14949";"I rescued the young man and the woman, just as the spirit asked. I should return to the inn and make sure Elynisi is all right."
"103224356-0-14951";"If I want to visit Shad Astula, I need to acquire an invitation. Maybe I can get an invitation from one of the students waiting along the docks."
"103224356-0-14961";"<<1>> has some definite ideas on how to conduct the investigation. She wants me to search Jofnir's quarters. I should examine his room to see what I can find."
"103224356-0-14962";"<<1>> asked me to meet her elsewhere in the region. She wants to make the run to Ragnthar with me."
"103224356-0-14965";"We've defeated the Dwarven automatons. I should speak to <<1>>."
"103224356-0-14966";"I should witness what the spirit of <<1>> has to say."
"103224356-0-14967";"I should speak to Merric about what to do next."
"103224356-0-14968";"<<1>> summoned the spirit of <<2>>. He revealed Sees-All-Colors as his murderer. I should speak to <<1>> about what we witnessed."
"103224356-0-14983";"While searching Jofnir's private quarters, I found a journal that mentioned a place called Ragnthar. I should return to Aelif and report in."
"103224356-0-14984";"I should follow <<1>> to Ragnthar."
"103224356-0-14985";"I should rescue the villagers from Dominion troops and find <<1>>'s husband, <<2>>."
"103224356-0-14986";"<<1>> ran off as soon as I destroyed the master crystal. He's probably gone to his home near the village center. I should find <<2>> and tell her he's free."
"103224356-0-14990";"The cave entrance is along the western pass out of town."
"103224356-0-14991";"I acquired an invitation to the Academy. I should speak to the Boatmaster when I'm ready to visit Shad Astula."
"103224356-0-14999";"I arrived at Shad Astula. My invitation says I should report to the Academy's registrar."
"103224356-0-15011";"A villager I saved said <<1>> is being held in a nearby hut. I must free him by removing any crystals or Dominion soldiers guarding him."
"103224356-0-15014";"I should speak to <<1>>, so she can start the ritual."
"103224356-0-15015";"The ancient traps and deadly guardians of this underground ruin are dangerous. <<1>> is just as deadly. I must keep him from recovering the Fangs of Sithis."
"103224356-0-15016";"The Hist key unsealed the door, which means I can enter the ruins. I must stop <<1>> and recover the Fangs of Sithis."
"103224356-0-15018";"Merric has begun forging the weapon's core. He needs a small fire to begin the process."
"103224356-0-15020";"The forging is well underway. Now Merric needs a medium-sized fire stoked to continue the process."
"103224356-0-15021";"This is it. To complete the forging process, Merric needs a large blaze."
"103224356-0-15025";"Somehow, the Arch-Mage knows I arrived at the Academy. He wants to talk to me in the main building."
"103224356-0-15026";"The Arch-Mage needs to make sure I can handle myself around magic. He wants me to go into the next chamber and solve the memory challenge. I need to touch the glowing orb and memorize the sequence."
"103224356-0-15027";"I watched the sequence of the lights. All I have to do now is touch the orbs in the same order."
"103224356-0-15028";"I completed the memory challenge. I should speak to Arch-Mage Valeyn to find out what he wants me to do next."
"103224356-0-15029";"Telbaril saw an old house up the trail. I should investigate for any signs of Rulantaril."
"103224356-0-15030";"A note in the old house mentioned that Rulantaril studied magic. He learned his craft from a witch at a place called the Blackfeather Court. I need to find the court and see if anyone there can tell me more."
"103224356-0-15031";"The magister said that Rulantaril locked the tower key in a cursed chest. The chest isn't far from the Blackfeather Court. If I'm going to get inside the tower and find Rulantaril, I'm going to need that key."
"103224356-0-15032";"I acquired the key to the tower. Now I need to get inside."
"103224356-0-15033";"The Daedric Lord called Crow Mother is inside the tower. She isn't rushing to attack me. I should speak with her to determine what to do next."
"103224356-0-15034";"I agreed to help the Daedra Lord called Crow Mother. I need to subdue Rulantaril and make him honor his agreement."
"103224356-0-15035";"I decided to destroy the Daedra Lord called Crow Mother. She fled into a tower. I should follow after her."
"103224356-0-15036";"Both Rulantaril and the Daedra Lord called Crow Mother are reprehensible beings. I decided to put an end to both of them."
"103224356-0-15037";"I ""persuaded"" Rulantaril to see reason and fulfill his obligation to Crow Mother. I need to tell Telbaril about the outcome."
"103224356-0-15038";"Crow Mother has been banished, and Rulantaril is free. I should return to Telbaril and tell him the good news."
"103224356-0-15039";"Rulantaril is dead, and Crow Mother has been banished. I should tell Telbaril."
"103224356-0-15040";"<<1>> asked me to enter the mine and save the trapped miners. She wasn't concerned with finding <<2>>. She gave me food scraps. I can use them to distract hungry Goblins."
"103224356-0-15055";"There are fires belowdecks, and I can see why. <<1>> has been using the second Fang of Sithis on her own crew. Time to take it away from her."
"103224356-0-15058";"I must search the pirate ship. <<1>> heard screams. I should look for the ship's captain."
"103224356-0-15061";"Rumor has it the innkeeper hates the stink of lizards, especially the ones from the Argonian quarter."
"103224356-0-15062";"According to rumor, the innkeeper hates loud noises, especially explosions. I've been told an alchemist living nearby keeps some flash powder in his dresser."
"103224356-0-15063";"According to rumor, the innkeeper hates the stink of lizards, especially the ones found in the Argonian quarter."
"103224356-0-15064";"According to rumor, the innkeeper hates loud noises, especially explosions. I've been told an alchemist living nearby keeps some flash powder in his dresser."
"103224356-0-15067";"I helped Lena, Tedras, and Hadmar pass their tests. Now I should return to Arch-Mage Valeyn and see if he's figured out what's going to threaten the Academy."
"103224356-0-15068";"The Arch-Mage believes that Lena Dalvel, Tedras Relvi, and Hadmar the Thin-Boned will emerge as great leaders in the Ebonheart Pact. He wants me to help them pass their initiation tests so that his visions have a chance to come true."
"103224356-0-15069";"I collected the healing supplies. I should bring them to Aamela at the inn."
"103224356-0-15070";"I should search the town for healing supplies."
"103224356-0-15071";"I should go speak to <<1>> about <<2>>'s strange silence."
"103224356-0-15073";"I'm reliving painful memories from <<1>>'s past. I must say the things he wished he had said."
"103224356-0-15075";"<<1>> was working beneath the Hist tree. He trapped <<2>>'s spirit with the same crystals the Dominion used on the villagers. Whatever he's doing to <<2>> also affects the Hist tree. It must be stopped."
"103224356-0-15078";"<<1>> decided to return to Narsis, Feyne's hometown."
"103224356-0-15083";"I must attempt the Trial of the Mind."
"103224356-0-15093";"<<1>> has contracted me to kill <<2>>."
"103224356-0-15094";"Now that I've killed my target, I should return to <<1>> to collect my payment."
"103224356-0-15095";"I've cleared the tunnels as far as the final room. Now I must search for the Ashkhan and defeat him."
"103224356-0-15096";"The Ashlanders should let me pass when I use <<1>> near them."
"103224356-0-15098";"Shad Astula is safe again, and it's time to move on. The students I helped want to speak to me before I leave. They're waiting for me at the docks, near the boat back to Mournhold."
"103224356-0-15099";"The Arch-Mage hasn't heard from the librarian, so he asked me to use the trapdoor to check the library vaults."
"103224356-0-15100";"I can ask my fellow Dark Brotherhood members and other people for information on my current contract."
"103224356-0-15101";"<<1>> is in town at a vendor stall."
"103224356-0-15102";"He only drinks from his own flask. I'll have to find a way to get him away from his wine bottle so I can poison it."
"103224356-0-15104";"Rumor has it that <<1>> trades in poisons."
"103224356-0-15107";"He runs Flash Powder for the Blacksails, but lost his wares to fire due to an accident with Flash Powder. He may have some in his stuff that I could use to spook him."
"103224356-0-15112";"<<1>> has asked me to accompany her to an ancient Ayleid ruin. She hopes our exploration will help us understand what we saw at Mzeneldt."
"103224356-0-15119";"I need to put a <<1>>, a <<2>>, and <<3>> in their appropriate chests."
"103224356-0-15121";"I need to put a <<1>>, a <<2>>, and <<3>> in their appropriate chests."
"103224356-0-15122";"I need to put a <<1>>, a <<2>>, and <<3>> in their appropriate chests."
"103224356-0-15125";"Now that I'm in the library, I should look around and see if I spot anything unusual."
"103224356-0-15126";"As I investigated the library vaults, someone ambushed me. I woke up in a locked cell with Tedras and Lena. \n\nI should speak to them and find out what happened."
"103224356-0-15127";"I should examine the gate. Maybe I can find a way to open it."
"103224356-0-15128";"A small banekin scattered the Maulborn outside and walked through the locked gate. It appears to want to talk to me."
"103224356-0-15143";"I didn't find Ra-shadda at Ruvali's home. Ruvali is kneeling over her husband's corpse. Perhaps she's spoken to Ra-shadda. I should find out."
"103224356-0-15149";"Ulov is dead, and the dro-m'Athra destroyed. I must return to Ruvali and Ra-shadda."
"103224356-0-15150";"A friendly banekin rescued us. He said that Arch-Mage Valeyn sent him. We're supposed to find Hadmar, who's hiding in the building next door."
"103224356-0-15151";"Hadmar set his totem up near a large rock to the north. I can use the totem to reach the lockbox Lena hid on top of the rock."
"103224356-0-15152";"When I found the lockbox and tried to open it, Lena appeared. I should speak to her."
"103224356-0-15153";"Lena thinks we should cast a spell of unlocking to get into the library vaults and deal with the Maulborn. I'll need to gather dust from the illusory monsters and use the wand to collect scorched Scamp hide."
"103224356-0-15154";"I collected the ingredients for the spell of unlocking. I should find the library trap door in the Arch-Mage's office and summon Tedras to cast the spell."
"103224356-0-15155";"I found the Maulborn general in the caves connected to the library. He enslaved students and captured the Arch-Mage. I need to deal with this villain."
"103224356-0-15156";"I defeated the Maulborn general. Now I need to shatter the crystal to release the spell holding the students."
"103224356-0-15157";"I'm back at the library door and the Arch-Mage's familiar summoned Tedras to meet me. I should give Tedras the ingredients and tell him what we're planning."
"103224356-0-15158";"I woke up in the Academy dormitory. It seems that everything is back to normal. I should talk to Arch-Mage Valeyn and find out what happened."
"103224356-0-15185";"<<1>> and I have arrived at the entrance to Ragnthar. I should speak to her and find out what we should do next."
"103224356-0-15188";"I must report to Sees-All-Colors about the incident at the Earth Forge."
"103224356-0-15194";"I should speak with <<1>> to start the Trial of the Heart once more."
"103224356-0-15196";"I must close the Daedric portals scattered throughout the Shrine of Saint Veloth. Each portal is anchored to this plane by a watcher. Killing the watcher will break the link and close the portal."
"103224356-0-15197";"Now that the portals are closed, the priests can eliminate any remaining Daedra and resanctify the shrine."
"103224356-0-15209";"I closed the portals. No additional Daedra can come through into the shrine. I should find Priest Dilyne near the central dais at the top of the shrine."
"103224356-0-15212";"Hectur hates Valen's singing and will fight him if he sings."
"103224356-0-15213";"Hectur hates the rats around here. If one gets into his bar, he'll chase it outside."
"103224356-0-15216";"I found Wideem-Voh, but was too late to save him. I should find his necklace and return it to his father."
"103224356-0-15217";"I should return to <<1>> with his son's necklace."
"103224356-0-15218";"Aelif suggested I speak to some of the other guild members. Perhaps they know something more about Jofnir's trips to Ragnthar."
"103224356-0-15220";"A daedroth carried off a holy relic, the Skull of Saint Veloth. I need to find Acolyte Hlen, who's been tracking the creature near the western crypts."
"103224356-0-15221";"During the fight, <<1>> killed Garyn. Tanval attacked Holgunn in a fit of rage and took the Coral Heart. I should speak to Holgunn."
"103224356-0-15222";"The treasure <<1>> expected to be in the Khajiit's hideout was not there. A pirate named <<2>> said he and his gang would be willing to help me track it down, if I spared them. I should follow him out of the hideout and up the ladder."
"103224356-0-15229";"Telbaril followed me to the old house. I should let him know what I found."
"103224356-0-15230";"A priest of Veloth claims the saint's fading spirit is expecting me. I should find the Vestige of Saint Veloth at the shrine entrance, on the stairs near the bridge to Tal'Deic Fortress."
"103224356-0-15231";"I should speak to the talking crow and find out what I can about this toll."
"103224356-0-15232";"The crows demand a feast. I've been commanded to kill eight bats as a meal for the murder of crows."
"103224356-0-15233";"I've been charged with finding silver treasures in Crow's Wood. They could serve as tribute to the Blackfeather Court."
"103224356-0-15234";"I paid the toll of flesh. The crows feasted on the remains of their monstrous foes. I should report to the Seneschal of Carrion in the Blackfeather Court."
"103224356-0-15235";"The toll has been paid. I've been directed to speak to the Duke of Crows, the leader of the Blackfeather Court."
"103224356-0-15237";"I should speak to <<1>>, the Mages Guild Mistress of Incunabula."
"103224356-0-15238";"<<1>> believes she knows how to summon <<2>>."
"103224356-0-15239";"We've summoned <<1>>. I should speak to him and see what he wants me to do."
"103224356-0-15240";"I should enter the portal to Sheogorath's shrine."
"103224356-0-15242";"I've retrieved the book. I should return to the Guildhall and speak to <<1>>."
"103224356-0-15243";"I should speak to <<1>>"
"103224356-0-15244";"I should speak to <<1>> about the location of the tomes."
"103224356-0-15245";"<<1>> said to follow the path outside into Cheesemonger's Hollow. The tomes I need are hidden there."
"103224356-0-15246";"A monster bars my way to the spellbooks."
"103224356-0-15247";"After I took one of the tomes, <<1>> made the rest of them disappear. I should speak to him and find out what he wants."
"103224356-0-15251";"I recovered the holy relic from the daedroth. I should speak to the Vestige of Saint Veloth and find out what to do next."
"103224356-0-15254";"I've collected silver trinkets the crows desire. I need to bring them to the Seneschal of Carrion in the Blackfeather Court."
"103224356-0-15255";"The Randoro brothers were clear on what would happen to <<1>> if he performed their routine poorly. I've decided to keep it a secret and just throw away the notes. I should speak with <<1>> one more time."
"103224356-0-15256";"The ghosts made it clear that if someone performed the rite incorrectly, he would be killed. I must decide whether to tell <<1>> about the performance and let him die. If I keep it a secret, that could save his life."
"103224356-0-15262";"Like <<1>>, the pirate captain was driven mad by the Fang of Sithis. I defeated her and recovered the second Fang. Now I should find <<2>> at his camp."
"103224356-0-15267";"Nojaxia requested my help completing her elixir's formula. I agreed to bring her grub grass for her experiment. It grows beneath the waterfall to the west."
"103224356-0-15268";"I must return to Nojaxia with the reagents I've collected."
"103224356-0-15269";"Nojaxia requested I give the elixir she made to an Argonian named Not-So-Quick. He's hiding behind a large mushroom in town."
"103224356-0-15270";"Not-So-Quick became ill after drinking Nojaxia's potion. I should return to Nojaxia and report the effects of her elixir."
"103224356-0-15272";"Nojaxia adjusted the elixir. She assures me she has it right now. She's asked me to drink it in the ""exact center"" of Lukiul Uxith."
"103224356-0-15273";"I drank the elixir. Now must return to Nojaxia, so I can tell her what I saw."
"103224356-0-15274";"<<1>> succumbed to the enchantment of the Fangs, but repented. More importantly, I've recovered only one Fang. The other is gone. I must tell <<2>>."
"103224356-0-15275";"I eliminated the Daedric threat. Almalexia said to find her altar when I was finished. It's in her cloister."
"103224356-0-15276";"I gave the <<1>> to <<2>>. Now he can return it to <<3>>. She's waiting in the village with my reward. <<4>> is safe."
"103224356-0-15278";"I should give Sheogorath's book to Valaste."
"103224356-0-15279";"I need to find <<1>>. He may know what's going on down here."

"103224356-0-15281";"I should find <<1>> in Shor's Stone to let him know I saved as many miners as I could."
"103224356-0-15283";"I need access to the prison, so I can speak with <<1>>. One of the guards could let me in and tell me where the general is."

"103224356-0-15287";"Irna asked that I find her family in the countryside surrounding <<1>>. I should start by looking for her husband, Gjakil."
"103224356-0-15288";"After we performed the Song of Sinmur <<1>> yelled to me that the bards were waking up. I should speak to her."
"103224356-0-15289";"I retrieved the books. I should speak to the librarian."
"103224356-0-15291";"<<1>> is building a pair of effigies to clear the way to the mine. She gave me a talisman to collect magicka from imbued corpses outside town."
"103224356-0-15292";"<<1>> asked that I channel the corrupted magicka into the effigies. That should lower the energy shield around the mine."
"103224356-0-15293";"I've collected the corrupted magicka into the Argonian talisman, as <<1>> requested. I need to get back to her."
"103224356-0-15294";"The mine entrance is clear. I need to get inside the mine, find out if anyone is still alive, and discover what the Reachmen are doing."
"103224356-0-15295";"Companion leader Vigrod Wraithbane is offering aid to the Pact at Shor's Stone. He's asked me to work with the Argonian, <<1>> to break into the Shor's Stone mine."
"103224356-0-15296";"I must dig citizens out from under the rubble of collapsed structures. Fires must be extinguished using water drawn from the wells. Finally, the bodies of the dead must be burned to prevent the spread of disease."
"103224356-0-15299";"I've worked to help the people of Riften recover from the giant's attack. I should report to <<1>> inside Riften."
"103224356-0-15302";"I should take the runestone to <<1>> in <<2>> to see if she knows anything about the dead Nord."
"103224356-0-15303";"The Pact's efforts to learn anything about the cult at Vernim have met with little success. Dajaheel wants me to help a Lieutenant Belron with a necromantic ritual. To begin, I'll need to cut the heart from a Worm Cultist."
"103224356-0-15305";"I should interrogate the cultist to learn why the Worm Cult and Reachmen are working together."
"103224356-0-15306";"The Worm Cultists are transforming the Reachmen as a part of an agreement between Stral and the head of the Worm Cult. I must report back to Dajaheel at once."
"103224356-0-15307";"<<1>> told me to look for a drunk bard named <<2>> upstairs at the manorhouse and convince him to help me perform the Song of Sinmur."
"103224356-0-15310";"I found Gandis. He told me the Reach broke into an ancient Companion tomb deep beneath the mine. A pair of relics gave them access to the tomb. I must find those relics!"
"103224356-0-15311";"I've retrieved the pair of relics the Reach used to access the tomb. I need to place them to open the door."
"103224356-0-15312";"I've made it into the Companion tomb! I need to find the shamans Gandis told me about."
"103224356-0-15314";"<<1>> has agreed to help me. I should use the instruments hung on the walls to teach him the tune."
"103224356-0-15315";"The toll has been paid. I've been directed to speak to the Duke of Crows, the leader of the Blackfeather Court."
"103224356-0-15319";"The miner I found mentioned several others being lead away. I should seek them out."
"103224356-0-15320";"I've performed the tune for <<1>>. I should speak with him again."
"103224356-0-15322";"Now that I've collected Engling's Lute, I should head to the southern island. <<1>> awaits me there to perform the song."
"103224356-0-15323";"Defend <<1>> while he performs."
"103224356-0-15324";"I need to use water to fight the fires. My hands aren't that big, so I'll need to find a bucket."

"103224356-0-15327";"The Sage of Skald's Retreat believes a powerful song can counteract Engling's spell. She's instructed me to speak with the bards of the Retreat. I must learn the lyrics and tune to the Song of Sinmur."

"103224356-0-15397";"Sheogorath has summoned actors that look like the leaders of the Ebonheart Pact. I'll have to destroy them to advance this insane trial."
"103224356-0-15398";"The ""Queen Ayrenn"" actress is the only foe still facing me. I should destroy her to move on."
"103224356-0-15399";"The only opponent still standing in my way is an actor meant to represent High King Emeric, leader of the Covenant. He'll have to be destroyed if I want to complete my trial."
"103224356-0-15400";"I think I've managed to complete Sheogorath's insane trial. I should speak to him to get my reward."

"103224356-0-15440";"Bosses are mean and don't feal pain the same way we do."
"103224356-0-15445";"I should talk to Geoffroi, but lie to him about Remelie's death."
"103224356-0-15446";"I need to decide whether to lie or tell the truth."
"103224356-0-15447";"I lied about killing the boss."
"103224356-0-15448";"Oh well even without the medicne I can die in peace, but in alot of pain."
"103224356-0-15449";"I should return to the dying guy and tell him what happened."
"103224356-0-15451";"I lied to Geoffroi about Remelie's death, but I may be able to get the reward out of him."

"103224356-0-15469";"I've found <<1>> and retrieved the Goblin totem for him. Then I heard a cry for help nearby. I should investigate to see if the Goblins trapped one of the other miners."
"103224356-0-15470";"I can use the totem to gain influence over the Goblin tribe. I need to engage Goblins in combat and show them the totem once they have been sufficiently weakened."
"103224356-0-15475";"I must find a ruin nearby, which Valaste says may hold a store of ancient knowledge."
"103224356-0-15476";"I've found the ruins <<1>> spoke of. Now to find those tomes."
"103224356-0-15477";"<<1>> asked me to place the tome in the flaming brazier."
"103224356-0-15478";"Belron left camp, hoping to learn more about the rituals. I should seek him out in the field."
"103224356-0-15479";"I must obtain the heart of the Graveborn."
"103224356-0-15480";"Belron needs more research materials from the Graveborn rituals being performed around Vernim. I have a lot of work to do."
"103224356-0-15481";"I've collected three more hearts from the Graveborn. I must return to Belron at the Pact camp."
"103224356-0-15483";"Belron suggested I slay any Graveghasts that channel energy into the Reachman."
"103224356-0-15488";"I need to report to Guard Verilu in Narsis and explain what transpired at Quarantine Serk."
"103224356-0-15490";"The Rift knows of the danger posed by the Reachmen. I should report in to Captain Jardirr. She said she'd escort her men back to the tower."
"103224356-0-15492";"I've sent the Reachmen's clanholders to Oblivion, as Melril asked. Now to honor his memory, I must plant a Pact banner at the top of the signal hill."
"103224356-0-15494";"Sheogorath says he wants one of his houseguests evicted, that they aren't fitting in. He also warned me that some of them are homicidal. I should talk to the guests and decide which one I want to evict."
"103224356-0-15495";"Sheogorath wants me to tour another part of his Chateau, a maze. He thinks the ambiance in there is too dark, and wants me to light some braziers as I go. He also said something about ""Bumps in the Night""?"
"103224356-0-15496";"I've found the heirlooms Sheogorath spoke of. He gave me some confusing clues as to what to do: ""Four lights in a row, poke one to make it glow."" and ""Four lights in a trough, poke one to turn it off."""
"103224356-0-15498";"I'm guessing Sheogorath won't let me advance without having a chat first. I should speak to him."
"103224356-0-15499";"I've survived Sheogorath's trials. Hopefully now he'll just give me the last tome."
"103224356-0-15500";"I spoke with the Retreat's librarian, a man named Bragur. He told me that Vaermina's nightmare creatures stole the books to preserve her secrets. He wants me to return them to the library."
"103224356-0-15501";"<<1>> leapt into the fighting at Boulderfall, hoping to save as many soldiers as she could. She's now missing. I've been asked to ease some of the pressure from the Pact troops. Some of them may know where she is."
"103224356-0-15502";"<<1>>, the military leader I met at Shor's Stone, has taken command of the outpost. I should speak with him."
"103224356-0-15503";"One of the pact soldiers told me that <<1>> has holed up in a small cave near the battlefield. I should find her there and ensure she's safe."
"103224356-0-15504";"<<1>> is fine. She insisted that my priority should be lighting the signal fire at the top of the nearby hill. I need to make my way there."
"103224356-0-15505";"I found the signal fire. I should light the starter fire near the pit. The smoke column should alert the region."
"103224356-0-15508";"I should tell <<1>> what I've seen in the spellbook."
"103224356-0-15509";"To gain revenge for his death, <<1>> asked me to kill the leaders of the three Reachmen tribes at Boulderfall."
"103224356-0-15510";"I agreed to save the three houses from the fire. First, I need to fill the bucket with water from a nearby well."
"103224356-0-15511";"I found <<1>> and an Imperial summoner, <<2>>. I have to stop him before any more Daedra show up to slay the remaining villagers."
"103224356-0-15512";"I defeated the Imperial summoner, <<1>>, and rescued <<2>>. I should speak to <<3>>."
"103224356-0-15513";"<<1>> said he won't let me pass unless I pass a test. He wants me to close a portal to prove myself."
"103224356-0-15514";"I collected the Graveborn's heart. I should speak to Belron."
"103224356-0-15515";"Paldeen and I have to get out of the Khajiit-controlled section of the ruins."
"103224356-0-15516";"Paldeen has prompted me to search for a tablet in the chamber ahead."
"103224356-0-15517";"The tablet suggests that I need to collect three sacred jewels from the ruins. The Eyes of Yokuda. They can be used to unlock the door to the Archive."
"103224356-0-15518";"I opened the Yokudan Archive. I should escort Paldeen while he looks around."
"103224356-0-15519";"I need to take the Cartulary of the Tamed Dunes from the unlocked chest."
"103224356-0-15520";"I need to find the Cartulary and then lead Paldeen out of the ruins."
"103224356-0-15521";"I survived the dangers of the Lost City with Paldeen and retrieved the Cartulary. I should speak with Paldeen again."
"103224356-0-15523";"Now that the portal is closed, I should speak to <<1>>."
"103224356-0-15524";"I need to follow the path to a town held by the Ebonheart Pact."
"103224356-0-15525";"Sheogorath has moved on. I'll need to follow the path to the next town, held by the Aldmeri Dominion."
"103224356-0-15526";"Sheogorath has moved on to the final town, a place meant to represent the Daggerfall Covenant. I should meet him there."
"103224356-0-15528";"The spirit's voice spoke of missing relics connected to its knighthood. Perhaps if I uncover these relics, the spirit will find rest."
"103224356-0-15529";"Upon collecting the missing pieces of the spirit's sword and shield, it accused me of graverobbing. Perhaps if I find its resting place I can return them."
"103224356-0-15530";"The spirit appeared before me at its tomb. I should find out why it has taken an interest in me."
"103224356-0-15531";"The spirit left to find its liege lord. Perhaps if I locate the liege lord myself, I can put the spirit to rest."
"103224356-0-15532";"I found the tomb the spirit's liege lord. I should explore it to see if I can find a way to put the spirit to rest."
"103224356-0-15533";"I should destroy the urn before the <<1>> returns."
"103224356-0-15535";"The spirit drove away the ghost of the <<1>>, who had murdered the spirit's liege lord. It asked me to destroy the <<1>>'s <<z:2>>. The spirit believes doing so will end the <<1>>'s threat."
"103224356-0-15536";"Almalexia suggested I start my search for Vox in the village of Selfora, east of Mournhold."
"103224356-0-15537";"Now I need to throw water on the fires burning in each house to douse the flames."
"103224356-0-15538";"After I put out the last of the fires, surviving villager <<1>> called to me. He's outside this house, so I should step outside to locate and speak with him."
"103224356-0-15550";"I collected the Eyes of Yokuda. With the Eyes in hand, I should be able to open the Archive door."
"103224356-0-15553";"I've extinguished the fires around the crops."
"103224356-0-15554";"Paldeen finished examining the tablet. He wants to speak with me."
"103224356-0-15555";"Belron thinks he knows a way past this death shroud. He's given me a jar of dark sludge and told me to drink it, if I want to get past the death shroud."
"103224356-0-15556";"I've drunk the potion. I should speak to Belron to learn what my next move should be."
"103224356-0-15557";"Belron has sort-of killed me. He hopes that will be enough to get me past the death shroud. At the base of the ruin, I should find an idol or totem. Destroying it should drop the shroud."
"103224356-0-15558";"The way is clear and the soldiers of the Pact are with me. I need to enter the ruin."
"103224356-0-15559";"With the aid of the Pact soldiers, I'm set. Time to kill Stral Blackthroat. When that's complete, we will need to regroup with the remaining Pact soldiers outside the cave."
"103224356-0-15560";"Stral is dead. Unfortunately, he took Dajaheel and Belron with him. I should return to the encampment and regroup with whomever is left."
"103224356-0-15566";"Once I've entered the cave <<1>> mentioned, I should look for <<2>>."
"103224356-0-15590";"<<A:1>> can send me directly to <<2>>, the Dominion soldier responsible for corrupting <<3>>'s memories."
"103224356-0-15591";"The idol has been destroyed, and the shroud is gone. Belron has arrived with backup. I should speak to him."
"103224356-0-15592";"I can listen to <<1>> if I need help remembering the tune."
"103224356-0-15594";"Destroying the crystals imprisoning <<1>> should also free the Hist tree."
"103224356-0-15596";"There are at least a dozen Yokudan relics in this ruin that I can retrieve."
"103224356-0-15597";"Nahrina is being harassed by a so-called debt collector. I should speak to him and intervene."
"103224356-0-15598";"I need to finish my business with Nahrina and let her know of her husband's death."
"103224356-0-15599";"I chased off the debt collector. I should talk to Nahrina."
"103224356-0-15602";"Before <<1>> can give me a blessing, she needs me to gather a special mushroom. She told me to watch out for the wamasu used in cultivating the mushrooms."
"103224356-0-15604";"I found the Yokudan relics. According to Tavo's note, Tavo's wife, Nahrina, is in Sentinel. I should travel to Sentinel."
"103224356-0-15605";"I should return to <<1>> for the blessing that will enable me to locate <<2>>'s spirit."
"103224356-0-15607";"Now that I have subdued the Gnaw-Root tribe, I should return to the mine and decide who should take the totem."
"103224356-0-15613";"While I examined this soldier, it's eye fell out. It must have been rotting for days."
"103224356-0-15614";"Bandages covering a soldier's mortal wounds are caked with clotted blood that has been dried for several days."
"103224356-0-15615";"A soldier's hand is covered with necrotic lesions. It must have been dead for several days."
"103224356-0-15621";"I collected a number of putrified body parts from dead Covenant soldiers. Strangely, these specimens appear to be long dead—several days old, at least. Perhaps Garyn will know what it means."
"103224356-0-15622";"I need to find <<1>> as quickly as I can. Shalidor says she's translated the last book I won from Sheogorath."
"103224356-0-15626";"Sheogorath told me the story behind his ""Uncle Leo."" The beast is apparently now an embarassment to the family, and needs to be disposed of."
"103224356-0-15628";"<<1>> would rather be destroyed than reanimated. He's asked me to light the room on fire. A nearby candle should serve that purpose."
"103224356-0-15629";"I can use the candle to ignite the books in the tower. That should put <<1>> and his friends out of their misery."
"103224356-0-15633";"<<1>> kept watch over me while I searched for and freed <<2>>'s spirit."
"103224356-0-15634";"I need to tell <<1>> that Wuuthrad is missing."
"103224356-0-15638";"I need to head to <<1>> and see what's happening in the area."
"103224356-0-15639";"<<1>> can stay in Percolating Mire to train as a healer, but he's free to leave with <<2>>. I should help him make a choice."
"103224356-0-15640";"<<1>> decided to remain in Percolating Mire to train as a healer."
"103224356-0-15641";"Sheogorath sure does love the sound of his own voice. Time to talk to him again."
"103224356-0-15642";"I've found my way out of the maze. Sheogorath is back again to have a chat. Time for another conversation."
"103224356-0-15643";"I returned the flesh to the Argonian victims. I should speak to <<1>>."
"103224356-0-15644";"I need to find the bodies of the other prisoners <<1>> spoke of and use <<Az:2>> on them. He said a Shadowscale, <<3>>, would then be able to find them."
"103224356-0-15645";"I found four of the missing prisoners. <<1>> said <<2>> is waiting ahead, farther into the caves."
"103224356-0-15646";"<<1>> says a lamia has taken pieces of his friends as trophies. Without them, their spirits cannot rest. I should slay this lamia and take back what she has stolen."
"103224356-0-15647";"I retrieved the prisoners' flesh and bones. I should return to the antechamber to meet <<1>>."
"103224356-0-15650";"I retrieved the prisoners' flesh and bones. I should return to the antechamber to meet <<1>>."
"103224356-0-15653";"<<1>> has asked me to make the bodies whole again by returning what the lamia tore from them. He hopes that will console their spirits and allow them to rest."
"103224356-0-15654";"I returned the flesh to the Argonian prisoners. I should speak to <<1>>."
"103224356-0-15674";"I should head to <<1>> and find <<2>>. He may need some help."
"103224356-0-15675";"Netapatuu gave me a crystal shard containing a fragment of Hakra's spirit. I have to jab the shard into one of the dead Worm Cultists just inside the cavern entrance. Hakra's spirit should possess the corpse."
"103224356-0-15676";"The shard enabled Hakra to possess the cultist corpse! Now to speak with her."
"103224356-0-15677";"I must destroy Hakra's burial urns. This will free her spirit and enable her to escape from the cavern, preventing the cultists from binding her."
"103224356-0-15686";"I saved Charadin and he escaped. I should see if Nila made it out of the cavern too."
"103224356-0-15687";"Now that I've reached <<1>>, I should speak to a local to find out what's going on."
"103224356-0-15691";"I should speak to <<1>> at the Mages Guild."
"103224356-0-15692";"Now that I've found the tomes, I must return to the Mages Guild and speak to Valaste."
"103224356-0-15695";"Sheogorath has created these actors that look like Pact soldiers to attack me. I'll need to destroy them to satisfy the Mad God's whims."
"103224356-0-15696";"Once again, Sheogorath has pitted me against actors shaped like soldiers. I'll need to destroy the Dominion forces to continue my trial."
"103224356-0-15697";"The actors representing important members of the Mages guild must be saved for me to move on."
"103224356-0-15699";"I gave Roselle the final page from Ulrich's journal which explains she's actually his daughter."
"103224356-0-15700";"There's a lone skeleton wearing Lion Guard armor."
"103224356-0-15701";"I found the empty husk that remained of Ulrich. He clutched on to the final pages of his journal."
"103224356-0-15702";"I have enough pages to reconstruct part of the journal. Now to find out what it says."
"103224356-0-15703";"Pages torn from Ulrich's journal are strewn about the ruin. By collecting enough of those pages, perhaps I can locate him."
"103224356-0-15710";"I've completed Sheogorath's little test. Time to speak to him again. Hopefully this will be one of the last times."
"103224356-0-15712";"I've slain Deathclaw. I should return to Hoknir and tell him his bounty is dead."
"103224356-0-15714";"The Daggerfall Covenant is backing the bandits at Hozzin's Folly. That's bad for Bleakrock. I need to speak with Seyne."
"103224356-0-15715";"I've safely recovered all the Fighters Guild soldiers. I should return to <<1>>."
"103224356-0-15716";"I should be able to find the lair of <<1>> by following the trail of things he dropped. Once I do, the beast might come out for some food."
"103224356-0-15723";"<<1>> asked me to speak to <<2>>, the Pact commander stationed on Bleakrock Island. I'll find her in her office off the central square."
"103224356-0-15727";"I should return to <<1>> and let him know the travelers should be safer now."
"103224356-0-15731";"<<1>> told me that the summoner took surviving villagers captive, including his daughter, <<2>>. I need to find his camp behind the rock outcropping and rescue them."
"103224356-0-15740";"I should speak with Merric about what happened in the Halls of Submission."
"103224356-0-15741";"<<1>>'s companions have been taken by arachnids. I'll need to break open cocoons in the area to find them."
"103224356-0-15747";"Aelif has opened a portal to the Earth Forge. I should enter the portal."
"103224356-0-15750";"It sounds like there's a commotion coming from belowdecks. I need to find the key to the hold so I can get down there before the entire ship burns."
"103224356-0-15756";"I need to enter the tomb."
"103224356-0-15757";"I made it to Stonefalls, along with Captain Rana and the refugees. I should check in with Captain Rana."
"103224356-0-15758";"I should return to <<1>> and tell him of my victory."
"103224356-0-15759";"Molla led me to a wand. I'm not sure what's important about it, but it's obvious she wants me to pick it up."
"103224356-0-15762";"I've arrived at the Earth Forge, a secret Guild locale. I should speak with Merric, see what he wants to do."
"103224356-0-15763";"Merric is eager to get started. I should try to keep pace."
"103224356-0-15764";"Merric is prepared to begin forging the weapon. I should see what help he needs."
"103224356-0-15765";"We've done it. I should speak to Merric to congratulate him on our success."
"103224356-0-15766";"We're under attack! I need to stand by Merric's side in defending the forge."
"103224356-0-15767";"Merric and I have defeated the undead interlopers. I should speak with him again."
"103224356-0-15768";"The spirit of Jofnir Iceblade appeared once more, this time in front of Merric and Aelif! They both seemed shocked. I should speak to Merric."
"103224356-0-15769";"Darj believes the ancient Dragon priest that once tended this shrine might be able to tell us how to get inside it. I should use the shrine to summon his spirit."
"103224356-0-15770";"I've summoned the Dragon priest's spirit. I must speak with it to learn how to enter the barrow."
"103224356-0-15772";"Now that I've collected three runestones, I should be able to place them in their proper locations. Then I can enter Skyshroud Barrow."
"103224356-0-15773";"A necromancer dressed in the colors of the Daggerfall Covenant is working to corrupt and control the Dragon priest. I must sanctify the priest's body to make sure this can't happen again."
"103224356-0-15774";"My first goal should be taking over the Goblin tribe. I need to kill their chief and take his head."
"103224356-0-15775";"I have the Goblin chief's head. Once I mount it on a spike for the whole tribe to see, they'll revere me as their new leader."
"103224356-0-15776";"With their old leader dead, the Goblins now support me. I should lead the charge into battle against the dreugh in the depths of the cave."
"103224356-0-15777";"Battle is joined. I must now defeat the dreughs' king, so the caves of Fungal Grotto will be free of all hostile creatures."
"103224356-0-15778";"<<1>> has come to the bottom of the cave, where her sought-after shrine is. I should speak with her there."
"103224356-0-15779";"Molla finally seems ready to talk to me. I should see what her story is."
"103224356-0-15780";"<<1>> told me a mad mage assaulted her and her friends. She's asked me to restore her friends. They've scattered across the island, and they're now skeevers."
"103224356-0-15786";"The way into the shrine is open. I should enter and learn what has disturbed the dead."
"103224356-0-15787";"<<1>> will want to know that the threat from the barrow has ended."
"103224356-0-15788";"Eiman is somewhere inside Orkey's Hollow. If he's still alive, I must find him."
"103224356-0-15789";"I found Eiman trapped in the ice. The ""Frozen Man"" challenged me to a game. Before he'll free Eiman, I must discover his true identity. I should search the cave for clues and then talk to the Frozen Man."
"103224356-0-15791";"I've discovered the Frozen Man's identity. He was once a spy for the Aldmeri Dominion. He invited me into his lair to play a ""game of shells."""
"103224356-0-15792";"The Frozen Man challenged me to a ""game of shells."" I must find and touch the real Frozen Man while avoiding his many illusions."
"103224356-0-15793";"The Frozen Man fled when I won his game. I must track him down and force him to release Eiman."
"103224356-0-15794";"I'm not quite sure how, but I convinced the Frozen Man to release Eiman. Now I must free Eiman from his prison and escort him back to Rolunda."
"103224356-0-15795";"Rolunda and Eiman are reunited. I should see if anything remains to be done."
"103224356-0-15797";"Ulrich betrayed those who followed him to Silaseli, but did so to protect his daughter, Roselle. Now I need to decide whether she should know the truth about Ulrich, or believe in a myth."
"103224356-0-15798";"I gave Roselle Ulrich's journal, describing his quest for immortality by allowing the cultists into Silaseli."
"103224356-0-15801";"I've restored Molla's hunting party to its proper shapes and sizes. I should find her in the village and speak with her again."
"103224356-0-15816";"I need to talk to Captain Rana and find out her plan."
"103224356-0-15817";"I must enter Orkey's Hollow to find Eiman."
"103224356-0-15818";"To disable the traps, I must flip a switch on the far wall of the first room."
"103224356-0-15819";"I need to speak to Captain Rana to find out the next step."
"103224356-0-15820";"Captain Rana needs me to unlock a door deep inside the tomb. The door has two stones on it. Each one bears the likeness of a flower."
"103224356-0-15821";"I unlocked the door. I should catch up to Captain Rana and find out the next step in clearing the tomb."
"103224356-0-15822";"Captain Rana will unlock the door at the bottom of the stairs. I must enter the room beyond."
"103224356-0-15823";"Captain Rana needs me to flip the switch in this room so she can enter the door above it."
"103224356-0-15824";"Captain Rana has run into the room beyond. I should use the door on the far side of this room and follow her."
"103224356-0-15825";"We must be close to the far side. I need to talk to Captain Rana."
"103224356-0-15826";"Captain Rana wants me to wait for the refugees to leave the Last Rest before I move on."
"103224356-0-15828";"I should untie <<1>>."
"103224356-0-15829";"Now I need to free the captive held at the Bleakrock Isle bandit camp."
"103224356-0-15830";"I need to put a stop to the bandit activity on Bleakrock. I'll begin by burning their supplies."
"103224356-0-15835";"With Sheogorath gone and Valaste's sanity returned, it seems we're well and truly in control of Eyevea. I should speak with Valaste to see how she's doing."
"103224356-0-15836";"I've found <<1>>! I should speak to him."
"103224356-0-15837";"I should head to the mill and try to call Rexus."
"103224356-0-15838";"The dog looks upset. I should pet it to calm it down."
"103224356-0-15839";"<<1>> wants me to follow him. Perhaps he'll lead me to Geilund."
"103224356-0-15840";"The Frozen Man's mind defies traditional logic. Perhaps if I talk to him long enough, I can convince him to free Eiman."
"103224356-0-15844";"We're saved! Captain Rana is speaking with someone on one of the boats in the cove. I should speak with her."
"103224356-0-15845";"I need to enter the portal Valaste opened to get to Sheogorath's realm."
"103224356-0-15846";"Seyne wants me to explore the mine and discover what the raiders are doing here. To get inside, she wants me to take a uniform from the raider scout she killed. The raiders' sentries can see through my disguise."
"103224356-0-15847";"I've found evidence proving that the Daggerfall Covenant hired the bandits. The Covenant wants access to an Oblivion portal and the power it holds. I need to get into the mine and put a stop to this."
"103224356-0-15848";"With the help of the disguise, I've entered the area outside the mine. I have to find out what the raiders are up to down here."
"103224356-0-15849";"The cultists left behind an artifact called the Unspeakable Sigil. It's maintaining this pocket of Oblivion. I can't risk the bandits or their Covenant masters getting access to the power here. I must destroy the artifact."
"103224356-0-15850";"Shalidor shouted that he sensed something wrong, and dove into the portal. I should follow him."
"103224356-0-15851";"Shalidor is waiting for me to speak with him about the island. I should do so."
"103224356-0-15852";"In his anger, Shalidor confronted Sheogorath. The Mad God easily subdued the Archmage. I should talk to Sheogorath and try to resolve the situation."
"103224356-0-15853";"Shalidor asked me to close the portals on the edges of Eyevea. That should stop the influx of Daedra. Sheogorath told me that to close the portals I'll need to pull out the nearby crystals powering them."
"103224356-0-15854";"Shalidor removed the ward from the Guildhall doors. Time to face Sheogorath once again."
"103224356-0-15855";"Sheogorath says he isn't the fighting type, so he's instructed Haskill to spar with me. I should do my best to defeat the Mad God's assistant."
"103224356-0-15865";"Sheogorath has ""kindly"" created a portal so I can continue my tour. I suppose I should take it."
"103224356-0-15884";"Seyne wants me to explore the mine and discover what the raiders are doing here. To get inside, she wants me to take a uniform from the raider scout she killed. The raiders' sentries can see through my disguise."
"103224356-0-15898";"Now that I've saved the villagers, I should head to the tomb."
"103224356-0-15899";"Denskar is inside. I should get him out."
"103224356-0-15942";"I need to speak to Seyne."
"103224356-0-15943";"Daedra swarm the island of Eyevea, and Shalidor is furious. He's gone ahead to the island's main Hall to look around. I'll need to fight my way through the Daedra to meet him."
"103224356-0-15944";"Sheogorath has given this island to us, but Daedra swarm from the open portals. I should talk Shalidor to plan our next move."
"103224356-0-15952";"Molla wants me to follow her. I'll see what's going on."
"103224356-0-15964";"Aelif says she will open a portal to the Earth Forge, where Merric is working on the Prismatic Weapon. Together we'll try to hunt down Sees-All-Colors."
"103224356-0-15968";"The Covenant has taken the signal fire. Rana needs me to work my way to the top of the tower outside town and light it."
"103224356-0-15969";"Now that I've lit the signal fire, I should meet up with Tillrani. Rana said she can get me to the rally point."
"103224356-0-15970";"The reconstructed journal reveals Ulrich to be a coward and traitor. He let the Black Worm into Silaseli in exchange for escape. I should find and confront this Ulrich."
"103224356-0-15978";"Captain Rana has disabled the traps and summoned the refugees. I should wait for the refugees to reach safety."
"103224356-0-16018";"I've closed the portals and slotted the power crystals out front of the Guildhall. I should speak to Shalidor once again to see how he's doing with the ward."
"103224356-0-16019";"Captain Rana asked me to help her locate missing villagers. I must talk to her about where to go to begin my search."
"103224356-0-16020";"Rana asked me to go to Skyshroud Barrow. I need to look for Darj, a hunter who left to investigate reports of undead in the area."
"103224356-0-16021";"Rana asked me to go to Orkey's Hollow to look for Eiman and his sister Rolunda. The centurion believes the young man went to the cave. Perhaps his sister left to search for him."
"103224356-0-16022";"Rana asked me to go to Hozzin's Folly to look for her sergeant, Seyne. The Dark Elf warrior went there to investigate reports of bandits."
"103224356-0-16023";"Tillrani is dying. She fears for the safety of the few villagers remaining in town. I need to save them. To start with, I'll have to get a bucket of water to douse the fires."
"103224356-0-16025";"I've got the bucket filled. Tillrani said that Denskar headed into the bunkhouse. I need to extinguish the fire outside the building, so I can get inside."
"103224356-0-16026";"Littrek ran off into the village. I should look for him. He might be hiding."
"103224356-0-16027";"Aera is inside the building. I'll need to pull her out."
"103224356-0-16028";"Trynhild ran off into the village. I should look for her. She might be hiding."
"103224356-0-16029";"Aera returned to her home, hoping for protection. I need to extinguish the fire outside the building, so I can get inside and find her."
"103224356-0-16030";"I must decide whether there's enough time to recover all the villagers before preparing to depart."
"103224356-0-16031";"I convinced <<1>> it's time to evacuate the island. I should speak to her to set this plan in motion."
"103224356-0-16032";"I found and rescued people from Bleakrock Village. I can tell <<1>> we're ready to go."
"103224356-0-16042";"Skorvild took some meat from the giant's leader and ran over to a stand of rocks. I should meet him there."
"103224356-0-16043";"Eiraki's borther Skorvild is gathering a force of warriors in a house north of the fishing camp. I should speak to him about how I can aid the village."
"103224356-0-16044";"Skorvild asked me to help the surviving villagers. He also wants me to gather supplies for his militia—rations made from an old family recipe."
"103224356-0-16049";"I found Burj. He explained that Skorvild and his militia have been eating the flesh of giants. That's why the giants are so enraged. I need to decide if I want to go along with Skorvild's plan or tell Eiraki the truth about her brother."
"103224356-0-16067";"I should head back to town, so I can make sure everyone made it to safety."
"103224356-0-16068";"When I returned to Dhalmora, <<1>> called me over with words of warning. I should speak to her."
"103224356-0-16069";"I think I've found all of <<1>>'s guar. I should speak to him, just to make sure."
"103224356-0-16070";"The Covenant's advance forces have trapped Dhalmora's farmers. I need to find them and send them back to town."
"103224356-0-16073";"I have the <<z:1>>. It's time to light the signal fires and warn Davon's Watch of the Covenant attack."
"103224356-0-16082";"<<1>> gave me some <<z:2>>. He hopes it will entice his ""family"" to come home."
"103224356-0-16086";"Now that I've closed all the portals, I should return to <<1>>."
"103224356-0-16090";"I should close portals around the grounds of Fort Zeren."
"103224356-0-16094";"Aera told me of a powerful portal forming in the heart of Fort Zeren. Darj wants me to help him close the portal and kill the Covenant general leading this attack."
"103224356-0-16095";"Alhana followed me into the house. I should let her know what I discovered."
"103224356-0-16099";"An Argonian told me that Covenant troops have trapped fishermen in the windmill. I should free them before soldiers set fire to the building."
"103224356-0-16100";"A Nord ran up to the windmill shouting that Seyne needed help. I should talk to her."
"103224356-0-16101";"I must reach Seyne on the docks. If she's under attack, I need to jump into the fray before Covenant troops overtake her."
"103224356-0-16102";"I must help Sergeant Seyne fight off the Covenant attackers."
"103224356-0-16103";"I must find Trynhild and Captain Rana. Seyne said they're on the other side of the docks."
"103224356-0-16104";"I've found Rana gathering her strength for another attack. I should speak with her."
"103224356-0-16105";"I must follow Captain Rana below decks."
"103224356-0-16106";"Rana and I have cornered the commander who led the attack against Bleakrock Isle. We must put an end to him."
"103224356-0-16107";"I need to leave the ship."
"103224356-0-16108";"Reinforcements have arrived. I should talk to them."
"103224356-0-16109";"Captain Rana ran toward the boat to attack the commander. I must find her."
"103224356-0-16110";"I told Kralald that I would search Kynesgrove for any sign of Captain Alhana and the missing soldiers."
"103224356-0-16111";"Captain Alhana and the missing soldiers are barricaded inside the Keeper's house. I should talk to them."
"103224356-0-16112";"Captain Alhana thinks the Keepers of the shrine may still be alive. She wants me to eliminate witches and bewitched soldiers to find clues. She also mentioned that I should talk to a less hostile witch by the lake to the east of the Keepers' house."
"103224356-0-16115";"I gathered the clues to the Keepers' fate: a hymn book, a soldier's journal, and the strange ramblings of the witch Leifnar. I should return to Captain Alhana and tell her what I found."
"103224356-0-16116";"I need to find a way to get into the other locked house in Kynesgrove. I should examine the house."
"103224356-0-16117";"Now that I'm inside the house, I should search for anything that might tell me what happened to the Keepers."
"103224356-0-16118";"Alhana followed me into the house. I should let her know what I discovered."
"103224356-0-16128";"I should speak with Merric about what happened in the Halls of Submission."
"103224356-0-16135";"It seems <<Az:1>> were a huge success. I should return to <<2>> and let him know."
"103224356-0-16137";"Haraldar asked me to check out the meadery and make sure the place was safe before him and his brothers follow me."
"103224356-0-16138";"I'm inside the meadery. I need to locate the recipe book and some fragrant herbs so Haraldar's brother can start making mead again."
"103224356-0-16139";"I woke up after sampling one of the new meads. Now that Voljar's Meadery is back in business, I hope Haraldar feels he honored his wife's memory. I should talk to him."
"103224356-0-16140";"The Snowpeak brothers now have access to the meadery. Once I turn over the recipe book and the ingredients, they should be able to start making mead again. I should talk to Haraldar and see what other help he needs."
"103224356-0-16145";"Yraldar thinks the short-tempered Kazok will be angry enough to challenge me if I kill more of his troops on my way to his camp behind the barn."
"103224356-0-16146";"I need to defeat <<1>>. He's the leader of the Stormfist soldiers that killed the Voljar family."
"103224356-0-16147";"With the leader of this band of Stormfists dead, Haraldar's wife has been avenged and the meadery should be safe now. I should talk to Yraldar."
"103224356-0-16150";"I need to find Sees-All-Colors. I must explore the Halls of Submission and find where she's gone."
"103224356-0-16151";"We've found Colors. I need to confront her, and see what she has to say for herself."
"103224356-0-16152";"<<1>> revealed herself as a servant of Molag Bal and a traitor. I need to kill her and escape Coldharbour. Before I can do that, I need to sever her connection to Molag Bal."
"103224356-0-16159";"I think I see an exit nearby."
"103224356-0-16161";"I've told <<1>> I would test his theory. I'm supposed to throw <<z:2>> at the Covenant to see if netch bulls will attack the soldiers."
"103224356-0-16162";"I found Trynhild. I should speak with her and see if she knows where to find Captain Rana."
"103224356-0-16163";"Roruld asked me to get rid of the giant that's frightening the bees east of the meadery. He suggested I kick a beehive to use the bees against the giant. He even splashed me with something to make the bees leave me alone."
"103224356-0-16164";"I killed the giant that was frightening the bees and collected its toe. I should bring the giant's toe to Roruld back at the meadery."
"103224356-0-16165";"<<1>> claims to be a servant of Meridia. She told me that she had no choice but to kill <<2>>. I must decide what to do with her."
"103224356-0-16166";"Jofnir appeared after Aelif's death. I should speak to him about what's happened here."
"103224356-0-16174";"On my way to help Rana at the docks, I found a wounded Argonian named <<1>>. I should speak with him."
"103224356-0-16175";"I've made my choice. I'm going to help defend <<1>> with <<2>>. I should speak to him."
"103224356-0-16176";"I must decide whether to help Darj at the fort or Rana at the docks. Once I've made my choice, there won't be time to change my mind before the Covenant attacks."
"103224356-0-16177";"I must go to the watchtower just past the village of Dhalmora. Then I can tell the troops there to light signal fires."
"103224356-0-16178";"The Pact troops at the watchtower are dead. I'll have to figure out for myself how to light the signal fires."
"103224356-0-16179";"Davon's Watch will only look for fires of a specific color. From what I've read in the ledger, I can find a new supply of <<z:1>> at the nearby fort."
"103224356-0-16207";"Fort Zeren's quartermaster is fresh out of <<z:1>>. She thinks a fresh shipment came in at the nearby dockyards. I'll need to go to the dockyards to get what I need."
"103224356-0-16208";"Hanmaer Furmender, one of the refugees from Lower Yorgrim, asked me to collect wolf pelts. She can use them to make blankets to keep the survivors warm."
"103224356-0-16209";"I collected the wolf pelts that Hanmaer requested. I should bring them to her at the fishing camp."
"103224356-0-16222";"I have what I need to light the fires. <<1>> led me to a secret path through the hill. It should put me behind Covenant lines."
"103224356-0-16225";"Yraldar wants <<1>>'s head on a pike. That should dishearten the remaining Stormfists and keep them away from the meadery. He wants me to do the honors."
"103224356-0-16268";"The book the cultists left behind described a ritual space inside the old tomb. I should find a way inside."
"103224356-0-16269";"The contract scroll I read outside the mine mentioned fire traps in a tomb. I'll keep my eyes open."
"103224356-0-16270";"I found a portal to a realm of Oblivion. To close it, I need to pass through it."
"103224356-0-16286";"I should make sure Rana isn't badly wounded."
"103224356-0-16288";"I should leave the way I came in."
"103224356-0-16292";"I should kill the necromancers in Haynote Cave."
"103224356-0-16293";"I killed several Shadowed Path necromancers. I should return to Vlastarus and tell <<1>>."
"103224356-0-16319";"I must head out into the courtyard and prepare for battle."
"103224356-0-16320";"<<1>> asked me to grab a barrel of appleblossom honey from the barn. He also asked me to keep an eye out for his twin brother, Bjoruld. He's supposed to make a delivery to Windhelm, but no one has seen him lately."
"103224356-0-16321";"I collected the appleblossom honey from the barn. I should bring it to Roruld so he can make more mead."
"103224356-0-16322";"<<1>> has been crafting some new flavors of mead. He wants me to try his latest concoction."
"103224356-0-16350";"I should speak with <<1>> in Davon's Watch. Then I'll verify they've received word that Covenant forces are on the move."
"103224356-0-16351";"I found Captain Alhana and the missing soldiers. They locked themselves inside the Keeper's house. I need to convince them to let me in."
"103224356-0-16352";"Captain Alhana asked me to put her bewitched soldiers out of their misery. I should bring back their blessed amulets to prove I'm not a witch."
"103224356-0-16353";"I collected amulets from bewitched soldiers, as Captain Alhana asked. I should return to the Keeper's house and give them to her."
"103224356-0-16354";"I should head through the gate to Davon's Watch and speak with <<1>>."
"103224356-0-16355";"I should kill <<1>>."
"103224356-0-16356";"I killed <<1>>. I should return to Vlastarus and let <<2>> know."
"103224356-0-16366";"I killed the Spider Daedra known as the Whisperer. Now I need to speak with Guardian Sud-Hareem."
"103224356-0-16368";"Time to kill the traitorous Khajiit."
"103224356-0-16369";"Bala searched the tombs to the north, but she was unable to find Eanen's name. She asked me to look to the west."
"103224356-0-16375";"I should help restore Voljar's Meadery. Fens asked me to speak to his older brother, Haraldar. He's by the farmhouse."
"103224356-0-16376";"I should find Eiraki Frostwind in the fishing camp east of the bridge to Windhelm and see what I can do to help the people of Lower Yorgrim."
"103224356-0-16377";"I've killed <<1>>. I should enter the trapdoor and return to <<2>>."
"103224356-0-16378";"I collected a handful of Kyne's Breath flowers. I should return to the Keeper's house to deliver them to Fresgil."
"103224356-0-16379";"I can find Kyne's Breath throughout the grove. It grows abundantly near the rune stones that decorate the grounds."
"103224356-0-16380";"I collected a handful of Kyne's Breath flowers. I should return to the Keeper's house to deliver them to Fresgil."
"103224356-0-16383";"I killed Ormi. Without her leadership, the rest of the corrupted Keepers will eventually slip away. I need to find Fresgil and tell her what happened."
"103224356-0-16384";"Something's wrong with Captain Alhana. I should check on her."
"103224356-0-16385";"I need to tell Fresgil and the remaining members of Captain Alhana's brigade what happened to their commander. I also need to tell them how the Keepers became Daedric witches."
"103224356-0-16386";"We can't take any chances. Ormi must die. I should look for her at Kyne's shrine up on the hill."
"103224356-0-16387";"I killed Ormi. Without her leadership, the rest of the corrupted Keepers will eventually slip away. I need to find Fresgil and tell her what happened."
"103224356-0-16388";"Sahun doesn't want to get involved. I'm on my own. I should return to Kynesgrove and put an end to Ormi once and for all."
"103224356-0-16389";"Sahun is praying. I should wait and see what happens."
"103224356-0-16390";"Keeper Ormi has restored the soldiers. I can find them in the Keeper's house."
"103224356-0-16391";"Kyne has forgiven the Keepers. She's restored Ormi and banished the Daedric influence. Now I should speak to the restored Keeper Ormi."
"103224356-0-16392";"I need to find Ormi's son, Sahun. He was last seen frequenting the Cold Moon Inn in Windhelm. If I can show Ormi that one of her sons is still alive, maybe she'll remove the curse from Kynesgrove."
"103224356-0-16397";"Praxin and his squad have succumbed to the whispers and turned against me. I must defend myself."
"103224356-0-16404";"Mera Stormcloak, thane of Windhelm and commander of the Windhelm Guard, wants to speak to me. I can find her in front of the Palace of Ysgramor."
"103224356-0-16405";"I entered the Cold Moon Inn as Thane Mera requested. I should look around for anything out of the ordinary, especially in the rooms the Stormfist clan occupy upstairs."
"103224356-0-16406";"I found the journal of one of the Stormfists, Leimar the Raven, in the Cold Moon Inn. It listed the locations of caches hidden throughout the city. I should search the caches and see what they contain."
"103224356-0-16407";"I recovered a number of notes and weapons from caches hidden throughout Windhelm, as well as a journal that ties these things to the Stormfist clan. Thane Mera will want to see these."
"103224356-0-16408";"The footrace starts along the western wall of Windhelm. I need to speak to Lenning the Hawk, the race organizer, to enter the event."
"103224356-0-16409";"Lenning the Hawk has directed me, as the last racer to arrive, to light the starting flare. As soon as I ignite the flare, the race begins."
"103224356-0-16410";"The race has begun! I should stop reading my journal and run to the next tower."
"103224356-0-16411";"The race continues! I should stop reading my journal and run to the next tower."
"103224356-0-16412";"The race continues! I should stop reading my journal and run to the next tower!"
"103224356-0-16413";"The race continues! I should stop reading my journal and run to the next tower!"
"103224356-0-16414";"The race continues! I should stop reading my journal and run to the next tower. Or I can stop to help another racer who has been injured and is lying beside the track."
"103224356-0-16415";"I won the race. I should speak with Lenning the Hawk."
"103224356-0-16416";"I abandoned the race to help Hadring. Unfortunately, he didn't make it. He provided me with useful information before he expired, though. I should speak with Lenning the Hawk."
"103224356-0-16417";"The race has ended and Thane Mera has asked to speak with me. I should meet her outside the palace."
"103224356-0-16418";"Someone killed Hadring during the race. I should speak to Thane Mera and let her know what happened."
"103224356-0-16419";"The assassin was seen leaving Windhelm, heading south. I should travel south, out of the city, and investigate."
"103224356-0-16420";"Thane Mera has something more to say before I proceed. I should talk to her."
"103224356-0-16421";"I found a camp to the south. Stormfist clan Nords and Orcs occupy the camp. Not a good combination. I need to punish these criminals and bring back any evidence I find to Thane Mera."
"103224356-0-16422";"I've been appointed as a Justice Carl of Windhelm. I can use this newfound authority to get answers out of any witnesses who may have seen what happened during the race."
"103224356-0-16423";"I retrieved a Stormfist Brigade emblem and orders signed by someone named Fildgor Orcthane that call for the death of King Jorunn. I should bring these to Thane Mera, back in Windhelm."
"103224356-0-16424";"Thane Mera fears that Fildgor's Stormfists plan to assassinate the King at the final contest of the Konunleikar. She wants me to enter the Hall of Trials to protect King Jorunn."
"103224356-0-16425";"I entered the Hall of Trials. I need to reach the arena and hurry to King Jorunn's side."
"103224356-0-16426";"The Stormfist clan is attacking King Jorunn and his guards. I need to help them."
"103224356-0-16429";"With the help of King Jorunn and his guards, I defeated the Stormfist assassins. Now I should speak to Jorunn the Skald-King."
"103224356-0-16430";"Fildgor's Stormfist assassins have been defeated and King Jorunn is safe. He asked me to tell Thane Mera that he's fine. I should go talk to her in front of the palace."
"103224356-0-16431";"I have been asked to report to <<1>>. I should speak with her there as soon as possible."
"103224356-0-16440";"<<1>> gave me the <<z:2>> I need to warn Davon's Watch. She wants to show me a secret path to the signal fires."
"103224356-0-16441";"<<1>> showed me a passageway that leads to the signal fires."
"103224356-0-16442";"I need to make my way through this passage and get to the signal fires."
"103224356-0-16450";"I need to find the captive soldiers in Fort Morvunskar and set them free."
"103224356-0-16451";"I need to meet Lieutenant Koruni and the other soldiers at the barracks near the center of Fort Morvunskar."
"103224356-0-16452";"Lieutenant Koruni and her soldiers have begun their assault on the barracks. I should help them."
"103224356-0-16453";"A Nord warlord, Halskar, commands the Stormfist invaders from inside the barracks. I should defeat him and search the area for his orders. We need to find out what the Stormfists want with Fort Morvunskar."
"103224356-0-16454";"A spirit appeared when I took Halskar's possessions from the strongbox. They included orders and relics from the crypts beneath the fort. I should speak to the spirit."
"103224356-0-16456";"I spoke to the spirit of Queen Nurnhilde. She asked me to return the relics to the tombs beneath the fort. Along with these relics, I recovered Halskar's orders. I should give the orders to Lieutenant Koruni before I go meet the ghost."
"103224356-0-16458";"The fires are lit. Hopefully, Davon's Watch will have time to react. I should return to Dhalmora and inform someone in charge of the good news."
"103224356-0-16466";"<<1>> and <<2>> disagree on what to do with the army haunting Starved Plain. <<3>> asked me to start by talking to <<1>>, to hear his plan."
"103224356-0-16467";"I've decided to enslave the spectral army. I must speak to <<1>> about what I must do next."
"103224356-0-16468";"I've decided to help the spectral army move on to Aetherius. I must speak to <<1>> about my next step."
"103224356-0-16470";"Denskar and Littrek are under attack. I should go to their aid."
"103224356-0-16471";"I must stand with Denskar and Littrek and make sure they survive."
"103224356-0-16472";"Denskar and Littrek have the situation well in hand. Denskar wants me to check on his wife, Aera, who has apparently come to join the men at the fort."
"103224356-0-16475";"Thane Mera told me a number of suspicious injuries and deaths have occurred since the start of the Konunleikar. She suspects members of the Stormfist clan might be involved. She asked me to investigate their rooms at the Cold Moon Inn."
"103224356-0-16476";"The dead are rising here. I need to find the necromancer responsible and deal with him."
"103224356-0-16477";"Now that I've killed Atirion, I should return to <<1>> to tell her the news."
"103224356-0-16478";"I promised Bishalus I would look for Gena. I should search the trail leading away from the docks."
"103224356-0-16479";"I found Gena. A rabid nix-hound attacked her, but the hound she had befriended helped her escape. Gena is returning to Bishalus. She's asked me to kill the rabid nix-hound."
"103224356-0-16480";"I've slain the rabid nix-hound. I should return to the two friends at the docks."
"103224356-0-16482";"I should search the graveyard and nearby cave to discover what's causing the dead to rise."
"103224356-0-16483";"<<1>> asked me to head northeast of Vlastarus to kill it."
"103224356-0-16486";"Now that <<1>> is dead, I should let <<2>> know."
"103224356-0-16487";"The race continues! I should stop reading my journal and run to the next tower."
"103224356-0-16488";"The race continues! I should stop reading my journal and run to the next tower."
"103224356-0-16490";"The race continues! I should stop reading my journal and run to the next tower."
"103224356-0-16491";"The race continues! I should stop reading my journal and run to the finish line."
"103224356-0-16493";"Jurana asked me to travel to <<1>> to see if I can recover any stolen items."
"103224356-0-16494";"I recovered several items from <<1>>. I should bring them back to <<2>> in <<3>>."
"103224356-0-16495";"Prince Irnskar wants to speak with me. I can find him on the battlements above the east gate."
"103224356-0-16496";"I need to prove to the Pact leaders that Prince Irnskar is fully committed to the Ebonheart Pact. To do so, I need to charge General Noramil's dagger in Stormfist blood and bring the head of the Stormfist commander to Eyes-of-Steel."
"103224356-0-16499";"I can report my success to General Yeveth Noramil and Eyes-of-Steel. That should improve their relationships with Prince Irnskar."
"103224356-0-16500";"Prince Irnskar asked me to talk to the Dark Elf general, Yeveth Noramil, and the Argonian commander, Eyes-of-Steel. I need to determine if there's a way to reassure them of his commitment to the Pact."
"103224356-0-16501";"I should report to Prince Irnskar and tell him what I did to improve relations with General Yeveth Noramil and Eyes-of-Steel."
"103224356-0-16504";"I should leave the fort and head through the gate to Davon's Watch, so I can speak with <<1>>."
"103224356-0-16505";"Ula-Reen asked me to light the watchfires at the south and east gates. I need to light the torch she gave me first, though. That campfire over there should do the trick."
"103224356-0-16506";"I need to light the watchfires near the south and east gates to Jorunn's Stand. <<1>> says it keeps the Stormfist troops from sneaking too close to the walls of the fort."
"103224356-0-16507";"I should let Ula-Reen know that the watchfires are lit."
"103224356-0-16508";"Ula-Reen discovered that the Orcthane is setting up additional camps to the south. Spymaster Ramorgol leads these efforts and must be eliminated. One of her scouts will accompany me."
"103224356-0-16509";"Shaman Moramat is next on Ula-Reen's hit list. I need to bring her down and recover any orders she might be carrying."
"103224356-0-16510";"I eliminated the Orcthane's spymaster and shaman and retrieved their orders. I should report back to Captain Ula-Reen and let her know her security issues have been dealt with."
"103224356-0-16511";"I've been directed to the keep, where Darj is conferring with Fort Zeren's soldiers. I should speak with him there."
"103224356-0-16512";"Keeper Ormi has restored the soldiers. I should return to the Keeper's house and speak to Captain Alhana."
"103224356-0-16514";"I lost the race. I should speak with Lenning the Hawk."
"103224356-0-16515";"The race has ended and Thane Mera wants to speak with me. I should meet her outside the palace."
"103224356-0-16516";"<<1>> asked me to kill some Rock Bone Goblins, to stop them from attacking the town."
"103224356-0-16517";"I killed some Rock Bone Goblins. I should let <<1>> know."
"103224356-0-16518";"The race continues! I should stop reading my journal and run to the next tower."
"103224356-0-16519";"I need to enter the royal tomb and return these relics to their proper resting places."
"103224356-0-16520";"I'm inside the royal tombs beneath Fort Morvunskar. I should make my way to the first burial chamber and see if I can determine where to return the relics."
"103224356-0-16521";"I need to return the old Nord cup to the appropriate altar in the first burial chamber. I should ask Queen Nurnhilde if she has any advice."

"103224356-0-16523";"The Truth of the North, a book of Nord proverbs, was damaged when the Stormfists plundered it. I need to recover the missing page and return the restored book to the pedestal."
"103224356-0-16526";"With the book of Nord proverbs returned to its proper resting place, I should locate the final burial chamber—Queen Nurnhilde's tomb."
"103224356-0-16528";"I made my way to Queen Nurnhilde's burial chamber. I see her standing by her stone coffin and she seems upset. I should speak to her."
"103224356-0-16529";"Fildgor and the Stormfist invaders stole Queen Nurnhilde's body from her coffin. They also took her crown, the legendary Crown of Freydis. I should track their path through the tunnel they used to access the tomb."
"103224356-0-16530";"Fildgor Orcthane has left an Orc champion named Shukul gro-Agluk behind to hinder my pursuit. I must defeat the Orc before I can continue the chase."
"103224356-0-16531";"After I learned of Fort Morvunskar's liberation, the spirit of Queen Nurnhilde appeared again. I should speak to her."
"103224356-0-16535";"I should travel to the bandit camp in the towers west of Vlastarus and recover the banner."
"103224356-0-16536";"I burned the banner. I should return to <<1>> in Vlastarus to let her know."
"103224356-0-16540";"I recovered the banner. <<1>> didn't mention that it features an Aldmeri symbol. I can return it to him or just burn it here, in a nearby campfire."
"103224356-0-16541";"I recovered <<1>>'s banner. I should return it to him in <<2>>."
"103224356-0-16543";"Reachmen have begun pouring into the courtyard, trying to extinguish the blaze. I must defend the fire!"
"103224356-0-16544";"I burned Talmo's banner. I should return and let Paints-the-Sky know."
"103224356-0-16545";"<<1>> asked me to put <<2>> to rest."
"103224356-0-16546";"I killed <<1>>. I need to return to Vlastarus and let <<2>> know."
"103224356-0-16547";"I should speak to Valeric and discuss Imhey's situation."
"103224356-0-16550";"General Vereth Noramil demands a blood contract with Prince Irnskar. He wants me to charge his magic dagger, Viper's Strike, in the blood of any Stormfists I slay. That would seal the agreement. I should see what Eyes-of-Steel has to say."
"103224356-0-16551";"The philosophical Eyes-of-Steel asks a lot of questions. To prove Prince Irnskar's commitment to the Pact, she wants me to bring her the Stormfist Commander's head. I should see what General Yeveth Noramil has to say."
"103224356-0-16552";"I should speak with <<1>> to get my final instructions."
"103224356-0-16556";"I've collected the five <<m:1>> and need to bring them back to <<2>>."
"103224356-0-16557";"Prince Irnskar suggested that I speak to Thane Harvald first."
"103224356-0-16558";"King Jorunn seemed tired, but he asked me to reassure Harvald and let the thane know that Jorunn's still running the kingdom."
"103224356-0-16559";"Now that the war council has concluded, the Skald-King wants to speak to me."
"103224356-0-16560";"Fildgor escaped with Queen Nurnhilde's body and the Crown of Freydis, but I was able to defeat his Orc champion. I should return to Fort Morvunskar and tell Captain Hamar what happened."
"103224356-0-16561";"I should talk to <<1>>. She'll give me further instructions."
"103224356-0-16563";"I should use the transit network to travel to the Northern Morrowind Gate."
"103224356-0-16567";"I've defeated the wispmother, but if she reforms, I'll need to slay her again to seal her remains."
"103224356-0-16568";"I need to kill Supernal Dreamer cultists and collect <<m:1>>."
"103224356-0-16569";"<<1>> believes the Vanguard is blackmailing the grandmaster. He asked me to search their makeshift barracks for information."
"103224356-0-16572";"I found Imhey, and she seems to be arguing with a strange man. I should find out what's going on."
"103224356-0-16573";"I gathered the bloodfiend dust. Now I should find Valeric's manor and see if he can actually help Imhey."
"103224356-0-16575";"I'm inside Valeric's manor. I need to find Valeric and see how Imhey is doing."
"103224356-0-16578";"I need to speak with <<1>> to learn more about siege weapons."

"103224356-0-16593";"<<1>> asked me to travel there and use a special crystal to absorb the flame atronachs' essences and lessen the danger to Vlastarus."
"103224356-0-16594";"I've collected the flame atronach essences. Time to return to <<1>> in <<2>>."
"103224356-0-16595";"<<1>> wants me to collect fruit and grain for the harvest offering to the Bad Man."
"103224356-0-16596";"I need to place the harvest offerings on the altar."
"103224356-0-16597";"<<1>> looks like he's waiting to speak to me."
"103224356-0-16598";"I only need to throw dirt into the fire to complete the ritual."
"103224356-0-16599";"The sacrificial fire engulfed me and I was transported into a series of strange tunnels. I think I'm underneath the tree. The tunnels are littered with scavengers and the dead."
"103224356-0-16603";"I found a woman named <<1>>, trapped by the living roots. She says I can free her by burning the roots with a harvested <<2>>."
"103224356-0-16604";"<<1>> is free of the roots. I should speak to her and find out just what's going on here."
"103224356-0-16605";"<<1>> has a plan to escape from the root tunnels, but first she needs me to weaken the roots by setting fire to tendril clusters."
"103224356-0-16606";"<<1>> is waiting for me to return with good news. I should speak to her."
"103224356-0-16609";"The Bad Man has been destroyed. I should tell <<1>>."
"103224356-0-16610";"The Argonian scout has additional orders from Ula-Reen. I should talk to him."

"103224356-0-16612";"I stole several silver scales from the poachers. I should bring them back to <<1>>."
"103224356-0-16615";"The note says a contact will meet me at the bar."
"103224356-0-16618";"I should talk to Thane Oda Wolf-Sister's housecarl, Jaema. She can tell me where to find Thane Oda and how to best approach her about joining the council. Jaema was last seen at the camp's front gate."
"103224356-0-16619";"Thane Oda is somewhere in the forest with her beloved wolves. Her housecarl suggested that I eat a canis cap mushroom to mask my scent from the wolves. They grow on logs outside the fort. Or I could fight the wolves, but killing them might upset Oda."
"103224356-0-16620";"Thane Jeggi Gap-Tooth is the last thane I need to speak to before the war council commences. I should find him at the camp."
"103224356-0-16621";"Thane Jeggi will only attend the war council if I get him some mead."
"103224356-0-16622";"I collected a few bottles of Voljar's mead. I should deliver it to Thane Jeggi."
"103224356-0-16623";"Now that I've extended invitations to all of the thanes, I should attend the war council at the healers' tent."
"103224356-0-16624";"I should listen to the thanes and Pact leaders discuss the Stormfist situation."
"103224356-0-16630";"I need to get out of here and report to Seyne. I must get out of the tomb."
"103224356-0-16632";"I've sanctified the priest's body and discovered the presence of a Breton necromancer. Why was a Breton in Bleakrock? I should search the barrow for clues."
"103224356-0-16633";"The only way to get Thane Harvald to work with Prince Irnskar is to get King Jorunn involved. He wants me to deliver a dispatch to the Skald-King, who's still resting at the healers' tent."
"103224356-0-16636";"I need to free <<1>> from the Supernal Dreamer cult's cage."
"103224356-0-16639";"I fought my way through the wolves to find Thane Oda. I should speak to her."
"103224356-0-16640";"Tanval has opened a portal which I can use in order to witness Balreth's attack against the Covenant forces."
"103224356-0-16647";"The antivenom kit should be easy to use. I need to collect snake venom to combine with the kit in order to make antivenom doses."
"103224356-0-16649";"Fildgor and his Stormfist allies have stolen Queen Nurnhilde's body and the Crown of Freydis. I should try to catch up to them before they get away."

"103224356-0-16656";"The rune I found suggests the Frozen Man is a powerful mage."
"103224356-0-16658";"I found a journal belonging to someone named ""Brimlor."" This might be the Frozen Man's true name."
"103224356-0-16663";"Aspera Giant-Friend gave me a horn. I need to use the horn at a nearby cave to summon a giant ally."
"103224356-0-16664";"Now that I have a giant ally, I should be able to use its strength to knock the Stormfist scouts from the trees. Then I can kill the scouts and collect any orders they may have in their possession."
"103224356-0-16667";"I defeated the Stormfist scouts and collected a variety of information about their current missions and procedures. I should talk to Aspera at the camp to the west and let her know what I found out."
"103224356-0-16671";"I've decided to take on the Vanguard directly. I should search their camp for any information about where the grandmaster's son might be."
"103224356-0-16675";"Now that the war council has concluded, the Skald-King wants to speak to me."
"103224356-0-16676";"I need to find the scout General Noramil mentioned. He said his name was Snowhunter. If I go north and east, I should run into him."
"103224356-0-16679";"<<1>> said I should find <<2>> and see what he knows about the grandmaster's son."
"103224356-0-16681";"I've rescued the stories of the Green Lady and the Silvenar from a corrupting force known as <<c:1>>.\n\nI should inform the spinners that their story has been put right again."
"103224356-0-16682";"<<1>> told me about the spinners' stories and the power behind them.\n\nUnfortunately, one of the spinners is not working to the interests of the Bosmer people, and he wants my help to stop them."
"103224356-0-16683";"A Khajiit bard asked for help re-writing a story in the spinners' temple. She said I should speak to <<1>> and learn more about it."
"103224356-0-16684";"Spinner Indraseth vanished right after she declared the Green Lady unfit for the Silvenar. Something's happened to turn this spinner against her people.\n\nI should find where she's gone and follow her."
"103224356-0-16685";"I've entered an unearthly cave system within Valeguard. I need to find a way to put the story of the Silvenar back to rights, so the spinners can continue to bless the Bosmer people."
"103224356-0-16686";"I met the original Silvenar in the story-cave and managed to protect him from an untimely end. I need to find Spinner Indraseth and put a stop to her meddling before she can wreak anymore havoc."
"103224356-0-16687";"After defeating a corrupted Silvenar, Spinner Indraseth appeared, but she was not the same. I should speak to her and find out what happened to her."
"103224356-0-16688";"Spinner Indraseth explained that there's a corrupting influence on the story, and it's spreading. She's asked me to find a way to save the story of the Green Lady as I did to the Silvenar."
"103224356-0-16689";"I've tracked down the corrupting influence in the spinners' story - a creature calling himself <<c:1>>. He's holding the Green Lady's story hostage, and I need to stop him."
"103224356-0-16690";"I've recovered both the Green Lady and the Silvenar's stories from the corrupting influence of <<1>>. I should find <<1>> outside of the story-cave and ask her if all is well."
"103224356-0-16691";"I've rescued the stories of the Green Lady and the Silvenar from a corrupting force known as <<c:1>>. <<2>> asked me to return to the <<3>> in Valeguard to finish the story."
"103224356-0-16692";"I've drawn the attention of Spinner Indraseth, the one who's changed the story about the Silvenar and the Green Lady.\n\nI need to find a way to stop her from changing the spinners' story."
"103224356-0-16693";"I gathered the ceremonial gems from the undead conjurers. Now I should take the gems to Finvir."
"103224356-0-16696";"The conjurers from <<1>>'s cabal now roam the tunnels as undead creatures, clutching gems from the summoning ceremony. If these gems are brought to <<1>>, he will prevent the Dremora's return."
"103224356-0-16697";"<<1>> is dead. The Coral Heart floats before me. I must retrieve it."
"103224356-0-16699";"<<1>> is back in the village. I should talk to Treethane Nilara and let her know <<2>> and <<1>> are safe."
"103224356-0-16703";"<<1>> is grateful for my help, though I was unable to save her life. I should see what her assistants plan to do next."
"103224356-0-16704";"The altars are cleansed and the array appears to be destroyed. The <<1>> is still here. I should speak to it."
"103224356-0-16707";"Aspera asked me to enter the fort. She wants me to free the mammoths and open the gates for the giants. A giant near the natural wall to the west is ready to help me. I just have to give him a poke."
"103224356-0-16708";"The giant helped me get inside the fortress. Now I need to head south to free the mammoths, and then unlock the north and south gates for the giants."
"103224356-0-16709";"Aspera wants me to enter the arena and blow the horn to challenge the warlord who commands this legion of Stormfists, Lob the Cleaver."

"103224356-0-17289";"Nedrek thinks that the Orcthane may have sent someone to investigate this ore.  They spotted a camp down the road. If it is someone sent by the Orcthane, I should remove the threat and destroy his orders."

"103224356-0-17306";"Thallik Wormfather escaped through a portal to the cult's base at Arcwind Point. Valdur says Captain Hrosta has gone after him. I should go through the portal and try to catch up."

"103224356-0-17326";"I found <<1>>. She wants me to wake Treehenge's matrons to defend themselves against the Worm Cult. She would have done it herself, but the creatures within have become hostile."
"103224356-0-17328";"I must take the <<mz:1>> into the city, but on the way, I have to defeat the Guardian of Silvenar, a huge creature protecting the outer bridge. Defeating it will give the Silvenar an opportunity to project his essence inside the barrier."
"103224356-0-17330";"The Silvenar believes the bonds holding the three Spinners can be unlocked, but only if I learn how they were bound. The only people who can tell me are the Houndsmen Bewitchers. I need to interrogate them."
"103224356-0-17334";"The Silvenar is using the silver shards charged with the spinners' energy to break down the barrier, but he needs me to get inside <<Ac:1>> and challenge the Hound."
"103224356-0-17335";"I must defeat the Hound in battle if I'm going to free Silvenar. But it looks like I'll need to fight the Green Lady first. The Silvenar said he'd come help as soon as he can."

"103224356-0-17345";"There is what appears to be a back entrance into the camp, but the door is locked. <<1>> will wait by the door while I find a way to open it."
"103224356-0-17346";"The door utilizes a puzzle lock. I need to determine the correct sequence of the axe, shield, and sword symbols to open it."

"103224356-0-17374";"Now that I've re-energized the sphere, I shoud leave the ruins before I get sealed in. The traitor, <<1>>, stands in my way."

"103224356-0-17388";"I destroyed the <<z:1>> the Maormer Arch-Wizard used to drain the captain's memories. I should talk to her to see if she is all right."
"103224356-0-17389";"Though she's no longer suffering from the Maormer's torture, the captain needs time to regain her strength. I must lead her out of the cave, where <<1>> and the remaining crew should be waiting."
"103224356-0-17390";"Stormfist agents are using Daedric alchemy to create exact duplicates of people in Fort Amol. Marla's dead body is on the bed, and I just killed another Marla who's lying on the floor. I should report to Guard Hloenor and tell her what's going on."
"103224356-0-17391";"I've cut the heart free of a Worm Cultist. I should bring it to Belron at the Pact encampment."

"103224356-0-17394";"We met the Pact dignitaries. They thought Rigurt was a jester. I wonder how he thinks things turned out. I should talk to him."
"103224356-0-17395";"It appears the camp has a cook and a chef. Kalogar cooks juicy bear steaks. Heggvir seems more refined and wants to make a savory goat stew. I need to decide which meal is best for the party."
"103224356-0-17396";"I decided that goat stew was the way to go. I need to assist the chef, Heggvir, by securing a goat for her cook pot. She gave me an herb to entice the goat. After I feed and pet it, the goat should follow me back to Heggvir."
"103224356-0-17397";"I need to find Commander Yjarnn and see if he'll tell me what's going on at Fort Amol."
"103224356-0-17398";"I need to find Commander Yjarnn's missing guard, Thod. He was last seen near the King's tents, drinking with the Prince's entourage."
"103224356-0-17399";"I found the missing guard, but he won't wake up. His condition could be tied to the strange Argonian beverage he was drinking. I should return to the bridge and tell Commander Yjarnn what I found."
"103224356-0-17400";"Lord Vurlop thinks that Commander Yjarnn has been acting strangely and he suggested that I follow the commander and see what he might be up to."
"103224356-0-17401";"Stormfist agents are using Daedric alchemy to create exact duplicates of people in Fort Amol. Marla's dead body is on the bed, and I just killed another Marla who's lying on the floor. I should report to Hloenor and tell her what's going on."
"103224356-0-17402";"The key to unlocking Silvenar lies with the three spinners. I need to take <<Amz:1>> to them, but I don't know where they are. If I interrogate Houndsmen Bewitchers or talk to loyal townsfolk, they can tell me where to look."
"103224356-0-17404";"Rigurt asked me to meet him near the docks in the eastern part of Windhelm. We're going to greet important Ebonheart Pact dignitaries. He wants me to wear the Dunmer cultural garb to show our respect to the Dark Elves."
"103224356-0-17405";"The Ebonheart Pact dignitaries have arrived. Unfortunately, Rigurt appears to be exceedingly drunk. I should watch what happens."
"103224356-0-17408";"<<1>> looks uneasy."
"103224356-0-17409";"<<1>> is concerned that she hasn't found her husband. It's possible someone in the camp may know where he is."

"103224356-0-17420";"The Maormer boats are scattered along <<1>>'s various beaches. Right now, I only need burn the sailboats. According to <<2>>, they'll take care of the rowboats later."
"103224356-0-17427";"The taskmasters are the leaders of these thug interlopers. They must be dealt with."

"103224356-0-17441";"I made the trip to Skyrim. Now I should speak with Vicecanon Heita-Meen."
"103224356-0-17442";"I must protect Tervur while we make our way into the mine."
"103224356-0-17443";"Commander Yjarnn and Marla just had a very strange meeting. There might be something hidden in Marla's house. I should investigate and see what's in there."
"103224356-0-17444";"Tervur had one last task to do."
"103224356-0-17461";"Saved Soldier"
"103224356-0-17463";"I convinced the Argonians and the Dark Elves to return to Prince Irnskar's meeting. I should inform Thane Harvald and see how he wants to proceed."
"103224356-0-17467";"The Worm Cult captured a Wood Elf named Arithiel, who freed some of her companions before being caught herself. She may be in one of the nearby camps in <<1>>."
"103224356-0-17468";"I've prevented the Worm Cult's ritual, which pleased Boethiah, but sacrificed Arithiel.\n\nArithiel's spirit appeared outside the shrine's exit. I should talk with her to see what she wants."
"103224356-0-17469";"I've figured out the trap's puzzle. Khanni's freed spirit appeared beside the tomb. I should speak to it."
"103224356-0-17470";"The thane has sent her court mage and closest advisor to investigate the attempted assassination. She's asked me to join in the effort. Golun, the mage, is at the Guild Hall. Borodin, the advisor, is at the Inn."
"103224356-0-17471";"I should speak with Thane Fjora to learn more about the attempt on her life."
"103224356-0-17472";"Sergeant Aera wants to know how the investigation is going. I should talk to her."
"103224356-0-17473";"Sergeant Aera, worrying that the local people may have missed something, wants me to investigate Betar-Nes's home. It's just to the south of the thane's hall."
"103224356-0-17476";"I found an unusual document in the house. I should return to the thane's Hall and report this."
"103224356-0-17477";"Golun has apparently been killed. I should speak to Aera outside the thane's hall to learn more."
"103224356-0-17478";"Aera informed me that she and her soldiers found Golun dead in the hall library. I should investigate."
"103224356-0-17479";"I used the glowing orb, and an image of Golun appeared before me! I should talk to him."
"103224356-0-17480";"Golun's research indicates the Worm Cult hopes to use ancient spirits to empower the ghost giant Sinmur. He found evidence their lair is in the crypt beneath Nimalten. I should investigate the fireplace to see if I can gain access."
"103224356-0-17481";"Borodin is here in the crypt! I should hear what he has to say."
"103224356-0-17482";"The cult is attempting to take control of Nimalten! Borodin has been set the task of keeping me distracted. It's time Borodin met his end."
"103224356-0-17483";"I should speak to Fjora."

"103224356-0-17485";"Aera Earth-Turner, my old friend, was behind the attack on Nimalten. She tried to kill the thane. I must leave the thane's hall and find Aera."

"103224356-0-17491";"Aera is inside the crypt. I must confront her about her betrayal."

"103224356-0-17497";"I rescued Arithiel, who may have an idea of what the Worm Cult plans for Abamath. I must collect the <<mz:1>> to unlock the entrance into the Ayleid ruin."
"103224356-0-17500";"I need to speak to the delegates in the Argonian and Dark Elf camps and find a way to convince them to return to the Prince's meeting."
"103224356-0-17505";"Golun was stabbed to death. He managed to crawl across the room, holding some kind of glowing sphere. I should investigate this glass sphere."
"103224356-0-17511";"Scout Anglith delivered <<Ac:1>>, just in time. I should attend the wedding."
"103224356-0-17523";"I've made it inside the mine. I should find <<1>>."
"103224356-0-17528";"I found the four <<mz:1>>. I must now place two in the sconces near the Ayleid door to unlock the entrance to the Abamath's ruins."
"103224356-0-17529";"I should seek out Jorunn and find out how I can help."
"103224356-0-17533";"I unlocked the door to Abamath by placing the <<mz:1>> in the sconces. I should check with Arithiel about our plan."
"103224356-0-17543";"I should present myself to Thane Unnvald in his manor."
"103224356-0-17544";"Thane Unnvald was extremely suspicious of my arrival. His Housecarl, Thorulf, has just arrived."
"103224356-0-17545";"<<1>> interrupted the Thane's paranoid tirade. He would like to speak to me."
"103224356-0-17546";"<<1>> reported that the undead have begun another attack. I should speak to Hallfrida."
"103224356-0-17549";"I've set free all the miners I could find. I should find Foreman Gandis and tell him the good news."
"103224356-0-17556";"I must place the last two <<mz:1>> in their sconces at either end of the ruins' main chamber to access Mauloch's sanctum. Arithiel will meet me at its entrance deep within the ruins."
"103224356-0-17559";"I've delivered the book to Shandi, the Khajiiti bard. I should see what she thinks of it."
"103224356-0-17560";"I've gathered the unusual materials. I should bring them to Farandor, who should be waiting for me outside the insect grove."
"103224356-0-17561";"Farandor needs some unusual materials to capture his tale. He's asked me to get blood from the hoarvors within Valeguard, and flesh from some creature called ""Old Tusk."""
"103224356-0-17562";"Farandor said I could ""lure"" the words by coaxing them out with the hoarvor blood. I'll have to wait and see exactly what he means."
"103224356-0-17563";"The words were attracted to me, as Farandor said, quite literally. Now that they've been captured on Old Tusk's flesh, I need to seal them at a fire pit in Valeguard."
"103224356-0-17564";"The ""book"" is complete, and Farandor asked me to deliver it to a waiting bard."
"103224356-0-17565";"One of the women in the hall has asked me to speak to her outside."
"103224356-0-17567";"Thorulf keeps his room locked. Sirkidur may have a key, but Hallfrida doesn't know how to get it."
"103224356-0-17569";"<<1>>, the grandaughter of Thane Unnvald, fears <<2>> has turned against her family. She's asked me to investigate his quarters. If I find anything, I should bring it to her on the fort's upper floor."
"103224356-0-17572";"Housecarl Thorulf has intervened with the Thane on my behalf. He warned me that I would be watched while I'm at Fullhelm. I've been dismissed, and should leave the throne room."
"103224356-0-17574";"I unlocked the door by placing the two <<mz:1>> in their sconces. I should enter the shrine of Mauloch and stop the Worm Cult's ritual."
"103224356-0-17575";"An energy barrier blocks the way into the sanctum, where the Worm Cult is preparing a ritual to summon Mauloch. Arithiel noticed something on the pedestal near the sanctum's entrance. I should examine the pedestal more closely."
"103224356-0-17576";"A soul is required to shatter the <<1>> and clear the path into the shrine. Boethiah says Arithiel is a traitor, but I should talk to Arithiel before I decide to sacrifice her to this stone."
"103224356-0-17577";"As a former Worm Cultist, Arithiel was forced to murder her own people, but seeks to atone for her crimes. I must decide who should die, Arithiel or perhaps another, in order to clear the entrance to the sanctum and stop the ritual."
"103224356-0-17578";"I sacrificed Arithiel's soul to the <<1>>. With Boethiah's Blessing, I must kill the summoners in the Shrine of Mauloch, before they can create a portal to Mauloch's realm."
"103224356-0-17585";"I've prevented the Worm Cult's ritual, and spared Arithiel's life. I should talk with her to see what she plans to do now."
"103224356-0-17586";"Arithiel is summoning a flame atronach to help me stop the ritual. I need to kill the summoners in the Shrine of Mauloch, before they can create a portal to Mauloch's realm."
"103224356-0-17604";"<<1>> has asked me to travel to Riften and speak with <<2>>."
"103224356-0-17605";"I should locate <<1>> in Stormhold, located in northern Shadowfen just south of Deshaan."
"103224356-0-17613";"It seems Tervur is not all he pretended to be. I must retrieve the deed from him."
"103224356-0-17614";"<<1>>'s soul has been sealed within Treehenge. I should speak to her to see if she has recovered from this ordeal."
"103224356-0-17616";"The matron of the spriggans said the cultists have all but exterminated the spriggans tending the roots of Treehenge.\n\nThe matron said a seed would allow the former Green Lady to root. It lies underground, where I first came in."
"103224356-0-17617";"<<1>>'s soul has been stolen away by the Worm Cult before I could seal it within the seed. I must recover it before they can sever it completely from Treehenge."
"103224356-0-17618";"Though I recovered <<1>>'s soul, the ordeal has severely weakened her. Lara and the matrons hope to restore her strength. I should wait to see if their efforts succeed."
"103224356-0-17619";"<<1>>'s soul has been sealed within Treehenge. I should speak to her to see if she has recovered from this ordeal."
"103224356-0-17630";"Though I've recovered <<1>>'s soul, it has been weakened severely. If it's to survive, I'll need to find a way to mend it before it's too late."
"103224356-0-17634";"Prince Irnskar and his troops are downstairs. I should let him know what happened."
"103224356-0-17635";"I should head to the keep in Fort Amol. Lord Vurlop will follow me."
"103224356-0-17636";"Lord Vurlop led me into a trap. Naryu Virian showed up just in time to help me. I should ask her what's going on."
"103224356-0-17637";"I need to enter the keep's courtyard and find a way into the Jarl's manor. Maybe one of the Stormfist troops is carrying a key."
"103224356-0-17638";"I found the key on one of the Stormfist soldiers. I should be able to enter the Jarl's manor now."
"103224356-0-17639";"It looks like Naryu found her own way into the Jarl's manor. But I see only one guard. Where are the rest of King Jorunn's soldiers? I should talk to Naryu and see what she found out."
"103224356-0-17640";"The King and his war council must be behind one of the locked doors in the Jarl's manor. I need to search the manor for a way to unlock the doors."
"103224356-0-17649";"The note said there's trouble at the mine in Lost Knife Cave. I should find the note's author, Eitaki Snowmead."
"103224356-0-17657";"Now that I have the key to the safe room, I should go inside and see if I can find King Jorunn and the Pact ambassadors."
"103224356-0-17658";"The illusionist Dhalen has taken the form of King Jorunn. The real King and the ambassadors must be behind the other locked door, upstairs. I need to find Dhalen and put an end to this charade."
"103224356-0-17659";"Dhalen and his duplicates are dead. I should enter the vault and check on the Ebonheart Pact leaders."
"103224356-0-17661";"I need to head out of town and find the bags of silk the bandit leader stole."
"103224356-0-17662";"I should return to Nimalten with the bag of silk. I'll need to decide who gets the silk. Or indeed, if I should just destroy the silk by throwing it into the fireplace at the inn."
"103224356-0-17663";"I've decided to give the silk to Enthis. I should give him the good news."
"103224356-0-17664";"I've decided to give the silk to Turil."
"103224356-0-17672";"I ran into Naryu when I emerged from the vault. I should speak to her."
"103224356-0-17673";"Prince Irnskar and his troops are downstairs. I should let him know what happened."
"103224356-0-17675";"The King is dying. I need to leave the vault and find someone to help him."
"103224356-0-17695";"I need to let <<1>> know that the ancient axe Wuuthrad is missing."
"103224356-0-17699";"I need to accompany <<1>> to the Shrine of <<2>>."
"103224356-0-17700";"I helped Skald Svari become Sage of the Companions."
"103224356-0-17706";"<<1>> has asked me to meet her at Fallowstone Hall."
"103224356-0-17715";"Now that I've awakened the matrons, I should enter the grove's center and speak to them."
"103224356-0-17716";"The matrons say the Worm Cult is plotting to destroy Treehenge with poison and take <<1>>. I should warn her."
"103224356-0-17718";"<<1>> said the altar in the nearby grove could be used to draw <<2>> from the cultists. She urged me to collect the nearby <<m:3>> and <<m:4>> and use them to cleanse the altar."
"103224356-0-17728";"<<1>> believes the shard of Wuuthrad that Thorulf gave him was somehow cursed - as soon as he gave it to me his fears of the Jarls passed. He'd like to speak to me again."
"103224356-0-17729";"The garrison is holding the keep, but the undead must be pushed back on all quarters. I need to raise banners at four tactically important points around the fort. This will signal the troops to attack and hold that area."
"103224356-0-17730";"While I was defeating the undead attack, something went wrong at the keep - the storage house is on fire! I should return quickly to see what can be done."
"103224356-0-17731";"<<1>> is just outside the burning shed. She'll know what's going on."
"103224356-0-17732";"The undead tunneled into an underground storage space beneath the fort. I need to enter the area and defeat the invaders."
"103224356-0-17733";"I've defeated the invaders. I should exit the storage shed as soon as possible - just in case Sjarakki hasn't manged to get the fires put out."
"103224356-0-17734";"The invaders are defeated. I should exit the storage shed as soon as possible to see why Lady Hallfrida is calling for me."
"103224356-0-17735";"There is enough time to either save Thane Unnvald or make Thorulf pay for his actions. I can't do both."
"103224356-0-17736";"While I spoke to Thane Unnvald, he was afflicted by an intense head pain. I should speak to him again."
"103224356-0-17739";"Hallfrida, now the Thane of Fullhelm, is waiting to speak with me in the manor hall."
"103224356-0-17743";"I have to find <<1>> and get her out of here before something terrible happens!"
"103224356-0-17745";"With the Hagravens taken care of, I should make sure Tovisa can get home before I leave the area."
"103224356-0-17746";"Tovisa let herself get captured to infiltrate the camp. I need to look around the camp for information. She gave me a Reachman outfit as a disguise."
"103224356-0-17760";"I've discovered that the Reachmen here worship a coven of Hagravens. I should go tell Tovisa."
"103224356-0-17763";"I should find Oda Wolf-Sister and give her Koruni's letter."
"103224356-0-17770";"I should explore Bleakrock Island and look for people who may need help."
"103224356-0-17771";"I met Darj, a hunter, at Skyshroud Barrow. He came here to investigate reports of undead in the area."
"103224356-0-17772";"I met Rolunda at the entrance to Orkey's Hollow. Her brother is missing, and may be inside."
"103224356-0-17773";"I met Seyne at Hozzin's Folly. She's investigating a group of bandits that have taken over the mine."
"103224356-0-17774";"I met Seyne at Hozzin's Folly. She's investigating a group of bandits that have taken over the mine."
"103224356-0-17779";"<<1>> said to get into the mystics' sanctum, find out what I can, and steal a key to the mine."
"103224356-0-17780";"<<1>> and the others are gone. I need to ask Gnarled-Root what happened."
"103224356-0-17781";"<<1>> has been taken into the mine! I have to get inside before something terrible happens to her."
"103224356-0-17784";"Now that I accounted for all the lost companions, I should return to <<1>>."

"103224356-0-17792";"I should enter the portal to explore the ancient ruins of <<1>> with <<2>>. I need to look for clues that explain what Doshia was looking for."
"103224356-0-17793";"I must enter the mine and locate the foreman. He may know why the Reachmen are here."
"103224356-0-17796";"Missing pages hold the key to a puzzle inside Taarengrav, one the Worm Cult must be kept from opening. I must collect lost notes and save any surviving delvers."
"103224356-0-17797";"I've pieced together what notes I could find about the ruin. I should head below and look for Kireth's apprentice, Daneras."
"103224356-0-17798";"Now that I've spoken to the spirit, I need to find the puzzle mentioned in the notes."
"103224356-0-17800";"Vigrod heard that Fallowstone Hall has been overrun and he's asked for my help. I can follow him or meet him there."
"103224356-0-17801";"Now that I've gathered the reagents, I should use them at the altar beside the stream to free <<1>> from the Worm Cult."
"103224356-0-17802";"I cleansed the altar, which allowed Finoriell's soul to materialize. I should speak to her to let her know what's going on."
"103224356-0-17803";"The cultists are destroying the spriggans who tend and protect the roots of Treehenge. I need to stop them before it's too late."
"103224356-0-17804";"A voice from the spriggans asked me to speak with it. I should find it and see what it wants to tell me."
"103224356-0-17805";"I've recovered the seed from the roots of Treehenge. This, combined with the fresh power of <<1>>'s soul, may fortify Treehenge against the Worm Cult's attacks."
"103224356-0-17811";"I have to find <<1>> and get her out of here."
"103224356-0-17812";"I need to kill the twin Hagravens and collect their heads."
"103224356-0-17814";"Now I have to kill the matriarch."
"103224356-0-17815";"I've done what I came for in the mine. Time to get out and see how Tovisa's doing."
"103224356-0-17816";"With the Hagravens dead, I should tell Tovisa that it's over."
"103224356-0-17817";"With the delver notes in-hand, I should be able to make my way through this door puzzle."
"103224356-0-17847";"I've come upon a Worm Cult ritual. They're doing something vile to the spirit that's been speaking to me since I entered the ruin. I need to stop them."
"103224356-0-17848";"<<1>>, the leader of the refugees, claims <<2>>'s husband contracted the plague and had to be abandoned in the crypts."
"103224356-0-17850";"Thorulf is dead, but Thane Unnvald has certainly killed himself by now. I should make sure Hallfrida is all right."
"103224356-0-17853";"I should return to the Keeper's house to speak with Captain Alhana. We need to determine our next steps against the Keeper and her witches."
"103224356-0-17892";"I met the ghostly image of a bard named <<1>>. She thinks her mentor, the <<2>>, can set things right. I should seek her out at the site of Engling's performance."
"103224356-0-17916";"I saw the Reach shamans perform a dark ritual. I should examine the altar they used."
"103224356-0-17941";"An energy barrier blocks the way into the sanctum, where the Worm Cult is preparing a ritual to summon Mauloch. I should ask Arithiel for guidance."
"103224356-0-17942";"I've been asked to report to Aelif as soon as possible."
"103224356-0-17945";"I must figure out the puzzle trapping Khanni's soul. She said words can solve the puzzle, starting with the poem about the Warrior."
"103224356-0-17946";"I successfully unlocked the Warrior and the Mage. The final puzzle remaining is the Thief."
"103224356-0-17947";"I successfully unlocked the Warrior. I will work my way around the tomb's base and unlock the Mage next."
"103224356-0-17952";"I should meet King Jorunn and Prince Irnskar at Jorunn's Stand."
"103224356-0-17958";"I have been asked to report to <<1>> at the Guildhall.  I should talk to her as soon as possible."

"103224356-0-17962";"I should head to <<1>>."
"103224356-0-17963";"I've reached <<1>>. An Argonian named <<2>> is crouched outside the cave. I should speak to him."
"103224356-0-17965";"I should head to <<1>> and see what has Valdur so worried."
"103224356-0-17966";"Now that I've reached <<1>> I should speak to <<2>>."
"103224356-0-17967";"I should speak to <<1>>."

"103224356-0-17970";"I should find someone who'll return these amulets to the families of the fallen."
"103224356-0-17971";"I should choose a companion to help me fight through the Worm Cultists ahead.\n\n<<1>> suggested I seek the council of <<2>>, <<3>>, and <<4>>."
"103224356-0-17972";"Now I need to enter <<1>>."
"103224356-0-17973";"I must find and destroy the Reaper Orb that is sealing the gate ahead."

"103224356-0-17976";"Hloenor Chill-Owl said she saw Commander Yjarnn and Thod walk toward the Guard House. That's odd, since I found Thod asleep by the river. I should locate the Commander and find out what's going on."

"103224356-0-18116";"I collected items for the recipe, but there's still no sign of Grida. Perhaps she's at the mill she mentioned in the note. I need to go there and grind the ingredients, anyway."

"103224356-0-18118";"As I ground the bath salts ingredients, Grida appeared. She was some kind of undead creature. I wonder if the bath salts had anything to do with her condition? I should speak to Dralof about this."
"103224356-0-18119";"I decided not to give the bath salts to Dralof. They're dangerous and I don't want to see Dralof and his friends get hurt. Now it looks like Frera Dagger-Lost wants to talk to me."
"103224356-0-18120";"I've learned from Nordahl that the entrance to Forelhost proper is sealed by a puzzle. I need to work out the proper order of images on the stones before the doors."

"103224356-0-18154";"I decided to aid the Argonian Dreamwalker. He wants my assistance before he'll help me save King Jorunn."
"103224356-0-18155";"<<1>> took the most fervent civilians with him to search for his missing captain, who he believes is still alive. I should speak with him right away."

"103224356-0-18181";"I fought the Redguard wizard and gravely injured him. He fled before I could finish him off. I need to find him."

"103224356-0-18377";"Sonya asked me to recover the remains of her three daughters. Her husband scattered the remains somewhere in Eastmarch. I should read the page from his journal. Maybe it has a clue as to where I should start looking."

"103224356-0-19019";"I have entered Valano Manor and now need to find Teldur."
"103224356-0-19020";"I returned to <<1>>'s side. I should speak to her one last time."
"103224356-0-19023";"<<1>> asked me to speak to the patriarch of the trading post, a Khajiit named <<2>>."
"103224356-0-19028";"Although Jorunn will eventually need my help, it's also vitally important I recover the shards of Wuuthrad scattered through Smokefrost Peaks. I must find as many as I can, then meet Jorunn at Trolhetta."
"103224356-0-19033";"I defeated Varaine Pellingare, a Wayrest noble who's been building an army in the sewers to take over the city. I should find his sister, Allene Pellingare, and deal with her, as well."
"103224356-0-19034";"Jacques is bored, but he's recommended two books I should read. I should read them and get back to him."
"103224356-0-19035";"I read two silly books and talked to No-Name. I should go tell Jacques what I think about all this."
"103224356-0-19036";"The Thane asked me to join him on the balcony atop the feasting hall."
"103224356-0-19037";"I need to retrieve Bartleby's cane from the ruffians who stole it from him. They're just down the road from him."
"103224356-0-19043";"Vofknir wishes to make a speech. I should humor him and listen."
"103224356-0-19044";"First, I need to find the camp."
"103224356-0-19045";"I've found one of the bards. I should speak with him."
"103224356-0-19046";"Logod said he and Jakaral were separated in the confusion of being drunk. I should try to find him."
"103224356-0-19048";"I have the key; time to release the prisoners."
"103224356-0-19049";"I need to head to <<1>> and see what's happening in the area."
"103224356-0-19051";"Now that we're at the Shrine of <<1>>, <<2>> has asked me to pray with her."
"103224356-0-19052";"Now <<1>> wants to go to the Shrine of <<2>>."
"103224356-0-19053";"We're at the Shrine of <<1>>. Time to pray with <<2>>."
"103224356-0-19054";"<<1>> and I have reached the Shrine of <<2>>. Time to pray."
"103224356-0-19055";"<<1>> now needs to go to the Shrine of <<2>>."
"103224356-0-19057";"I need to find Captain Viveka in the <<1>> cave."
"103224356-0-19058";"I need to find Captain Viveka in the <<1>> cave."
"103224356-0-19059";"I must stop Gullveig's ritual!"
"103224356-0-19060";"I need to follow Captain Viveka into the lich's sanctum."
"103224356-0-19061";"I should collect the shard of Wuuthrad to prevent the Worm Cult from getting their filthy paws on it again."
"103224356-0-19063";"<<1>> has asked me to watch her ascend to the position of Sage of Fallowstone Hall."
"103224356-0-19067";"The Boneshaper clan is besieging Shor's Stone. Aera can't take out both the clan's Clan Matron and the Daggerfall Covenant spy meeting with her. I volunteered to help by killing them both."
"103224356-0-19068";"The Boneshaper Clan Matron, the Clan Matron's daughter, and the Daggerfall Covenant spy are dead. I should tell Aera."
"103224356-0-19069";"With Gullveig taken care of, I should release Captain Viveka."
"103224356-0-19070";"I should wait a moment before speaking with Hendil. This looks serious."
"103224356-0-19072";"The village is filled with statues and a very distracted mage. Perhaps he knows what happened to these people? I should speak with him."
"103224356-0-19073";"Something went wrong with the banishing spell and a Flame Atronoch was released from the bear. I should speak to <<1>>."
"103224356-0-19074";"I learned that <<1>> is responsible for unleashing the Daedra on the local wildlife. I need to enter the cave and kill the Daedric leader that resides there."

"103224356-0-19084";"I dispatched the beast that attacked <<1>>. I should speak with her again."
"103224356-0-19091";"I have a frivolous book of Skald's drinking songs for Mininque. I also read a tome of his ""darker"" sonnets. He's writing about Daedra, and that's suspicious. I should let her know."
"103224356-0-19093";"Skald Skullsplitter is a drunken Nord poet. An Altmer admirer asked me to acquire a book from him."
"103224356-0-19094";"Skald Skullsplitter offered me book of drinking songs left on a nearby table. I should get a copy for Mininque."
"103224356-0-19098";"<<1>> told me that he turned the villagers to stone. His goal was to protect them from Daedra. He's instructed me to dispel the energies around monoliths in the woods. That should clear the Daedric influence from the area. He hopes."
"103224356-0-19100";"As the champion of Geirmund's Hall, it's my duty to escort this drunken bard to safety."
"103224356-0-19102";"<<1>> needs a bear to act as a test subject. The <<2>> he gave me should allow me to befriend one of the posessed creatures."
"103224356-0-19103";"Something must have happened to this poor villager. Perhaps I can find out more in town?"
"103224356-0-19104";"I captured a bear. <<1>> instructed me to take the bear to his tower in the grove."
"103224356-0-19105";"I brought the bear to <<1>>'s tower. I should observe as he does his spell."
"103224356-0-19107";"I uncovered Hendil's journal, which contains information on the source of the plague. I should take it to Velatosse."
"103224356-0-19108";"Velatosse is very upset that the mercenaries are guarding Hendil's home, as well as the quarantine area. She thinks the alchemist is hiding something. I should sneak past the guards and pick the front lock, or try to find an alternate way in."
"103224356-0-19109";"Hendil's journal indicates that something is amiss in the quarantine. Velatosse is very upset, as her elder son has now been taken as well. She's asked me to enter the cave and find out what's going on. Just need to figure out how to get in there."
"103224356-0-19110";"Eifra told me to start by speaking with her sister, Aelm."
"103224356-0-19111";"This contest has gotten strange. Eirfa says I need to recite a poem for those gathered around the nearby stage. Before I do, I must drink an especially potent ale."
"103224356-0-19113";"I need to recite Geirmund's Oath, if I can remember it."
"103224356-0-19117";"I entered a strange world of ice and freezing rain. I should find <<1>> as soon as I can."
"103224356-0-19118";"<<1>> is delusional. He says he's freezing, but won't leave the cave because he's cold. I need to collect some fire-starting supplies from around the cave. If he was warmer, perhaps he'd listen to reason."
"103224356-0-19119";"I have the materials I need to start a fire. I should do so. Perhaps then I can talk to <<1>>."
"103224356-0-19120";"<<1>> seems to be warming up. I should talk to him to see if he's returned to sanity."
"103224356-0-19121";"I have to collect items around <<1>> that identify the dead."
"103224356-0-19122";"I've collected some items to identify the dead. Time to go talk to <<1>>."
"103224356-0-19123";"<<1>> died waiting for me. I'll check to see if he has a personal item."
"103224356-0-19124";"With all the personal effects collected, I need to bring them to the families in Riften."
"103224356-0-19125";"Now to deliver the handkerchief to Svein's family."
"103224356-0-19127";"The captain has run off to rally her troops. Hopefully all of the scheming so far will pay off, and she will find herself without an army."
"103224356-0-19130";"I have a book of Skald's drinking songs. I should check to see if it's autographed."
"103224356-0-19133";"To prove Thorulf is a traitor, I must retrieve Thane Unvald's ancient sword, Bonebane, from the battle memorial southeast of Fullhelm Fort.\n\nThorulf claimed the blade was destroyed. Returning it intact will prove him a liar."
"103224356-0-19134";"When I mentioned that Mininque wanted more than a book of drinking songs, Skullsplitter started talking suspiciously about a ""darker"" book of sonnets. I should investigate and read it."
"103224356-0-19139";"I've delivered the altered letter to the Gold Coast captain. I should see what the Baandari's plans are next."
"103224356-0-19159";"I've entered a strange cavern full of mushrooms and monsters. I should try to find <<1>> as soon as I can."
"103224356-0-19160";"It seems I need to find mushroom spores in order to make the potion needed to return <<1>> to sanity. I should search the cavern for those mushrooms and collect them."
"103224356-0-19162";"<<1>> seems to be more lucid. I should speak to him."
"103224356-0-19163";"I should be able to dispel <<1>> using the <<2>>. Time to make use of it."
"103224356-0-19164";"I've met <<1>> at Fallowstone Hall. Time to give her the <<2>>."
"103224356-0-19173";"I freed the members of Queen Ayrenn's entourage. All that's left now is to find and confront the mad Mage <<1>>."
"103224356-0-19174";"I need to find the cave where the Daedra is hiding."
"103224356-0-19175";"Outside the cave, I found a wounded woman near the body of a dead mage. I should speak to her."
"103224356-0-19176";"<<1>> teleported to me once I finished with the monoliths. I should speak to him."
"103224356-0-19177";"I made my way into the cave and caught sight of Hendil running down a corridor. I should follow him to see what he can tell me."
"103224356-0-19178";"I have an autographed book for Mininque. She said she wanted a second one. I might as well ask."
"103224356-0-19179";"I came across Nelulin, Velatosse's son. I should talk to him to see if he's all right."
"103224356-0-19180";"Nelulin is weak, but not sick. He asked me to follow Hendil and Amuur further down the corridor to see why they put him in quarantine."
"103224356-0-19181";"Hendil has sent Amuur to stop me. I need to take him down."
"103224356-0-19182";"Hendil is still somewhere out there in the mine. I have to find him."
"103224356-0-19183";"Hendil's son is a vampire! The alchemist has been feeding his fellow villagers to the beast as he worked to find a cure. There's only one choice: Tancano has to die."
"103224356-0-19184";"I must confront Hendil."
"103224356-0-19185";"Hendil has surrendered, but can't face the villagers outside. I left him tied up in the mine for the time being. I should return to the surface."
"103224356-0-19187";"There's a woman here, dressed in finery. A member of the Queen's entourage? I should speak with her."
"103224356-0-19190";"Eminelya's directed me through a cave and into a hidden Vale. She believes the mage has taken her companions there."
"103224356-0-19199";"I need to talk to Captain Viveka now."
"103224356-0-19204";"<<1>> is afraid to return to the village. She said she was bitten, but wouldn't say by what. She blames a nearby spring for what happened to the Tanglehaven militia. I should follow her there and see what she means."
"103224356-0-19205";"A spirit at Hircine's shrine said <<1>> ""took the gift willingly."" It said she was lost, but that she could save <<2>> from the same fate with her ""sire's heartblood.""\n\nI should speak to <<1>> and find out exactly what it meant."
"103224356-0-19206";"<<1>> turned into a werewolf! Just before her transformation, she confessed that her father's plan for revenge against the Drublog led her to agree to accept Hircine's gift. She fears <<2>> is in danger and asked me to find her."
"103224356-0-19207";"<<1>> is unwell. As <<2>> feared, her mother was bitten by <<3>>. If nothing is done, the treethane will become a werewolf as well.\n\nNow that <<2>> has regained control of herself, I should speak with her and see what must be done."
"103224356-0-19208";"In order to save her mother from becoming a werewolf, <<1>> must recover the ""heartblood"" of her own father. This can only end in <<2>>'s death.\n\n<<1>> asked me to help defeat him, as she fears she won't be able to do it alone."
"103224356-0-19213";"<<1>> brought her father's heartblood to <<2>>. I should speak with her and see if we arrived in time."
"103224356-0-19214";"<<1>> brought her father's heartblood to <<2>>. I should speak with her and see if we arrived in time."
"103224356-0-19215";"Another forest spirit has appeared nearby. I should follow it."
"103224356-0-19217";"When Anenwen spoke to <<1>>, he claimed his intentions were noble. I should speak to <<2>>. Perhaps I can influence what will happen to the misguided mage."
"103224356-0-19218";"I spoke to <<1>> and told her that <<2>> was just trying to help. I should speak to him for my reward."
"103224356-0-19230";"<<1>>'s sent me to meet his assistant, and finish the plan we're set in motion."
"103224356-0-19235";"I agreed to head to Pinepeak and help the researchers."
"103224356-0-19236";"Now that the Daedric leader is dead, the animals should return to normal. I need to confront <<1>> back in town about <<2>>'s accusations."
"103224356-0-19238";"I have to protect the scout so he can lead me to the cultists."
"103224356-0-19240";"I should talk to <<1>> to let her know that we've stopped the cultists."
"103224356-0-19241";"Talking to <<1>> was singularly unhelpful, but he seemed to say I could create a potion that would snap him out of his enthrallment. I should search <<2>>'s to see if I can find anything useful."
"103224356-0-19243";"I tipped off Bronorr to Bar-Neeus's contraband. Now to watch him get arrested."
"103224356-0-19266";"The guard suggested <<1>> might have been kidnapped by the Houndsmen. I should talk to <<2>> and see what she can tell me."
"103224356-0-19287";"I need to search Hendil's home for some evidence of foul play."
"103224356-0-19288";"I need to search Hendil's home for some evidence of foul play."
"103224356-0-19295";"I've slain <<1>>. I have the sad duty to inform his daughter."
"103224356-0-19296";"A magical projection has appeared, taunting me. This must be the mad mage. I should speak to him."
"103224356-0-19299";"I spooked Rhavil. I need to leave the area around his house before he'll leave it again."
"103224356-0-19304";"As expected, <<1>> agreed to transport <<2>> for a share of the treasure. Now to get the treasure from <<2>>."
"103224356-0-19305";"<<1>>'s in no shape to fight the Maormer, so he gave me the location of his buried treasure. I just need to recover it from caves around Horseshoe Island."
"103224356-0-19307";"Though <<1>> seems to believe his junk is treasure, I'm not sure <<2>> will stick to the original deal, especially since his only share will be some fish bones."
"103224356-0-19310";"<<1>> refused to take <<2>> to Island. I should let him know the bad news."
"103224356-0-19315";"The teleportation scroll has seen <<1>> free of this madness. I should leave her realm of rage."
"103224356-0-19316";"I used the telport scroll to evacuate Merion. I should leave the area."
"103224356-0-19317";"I managed to evacuate <<1>> with the teleportation scroll. I need to leave <<2>> as soon as I can."
"103224356-0-19336";"I should search the farm and mill for clues as to what happened here."
"103224356-0-19337";"Raerana asked me to seek out her uncle, Wilrek Snow-Shod, at the Withered Tree tavern in Riften. He may reward me for saving his niece."
"103224356-0-19344";"I should look inside the farmhouse for clues."
"103224356-0-19345";"I found a letter addressed to Raerana hidden between the pages of a book. Its contents could shed some light on the murders."
"103224356-0-19350";"The letter appears to be from Raerana's secret lover, Rilyn. He mentions a meeting place. I should ask Raerana about this."
"103224356-0-19351";"Raerana revealed the location of the cave where she and Rilyn meet. I should go there to see if I can find him."
"103224356-0-19352";"I refused to help Rilyn cover up his crime. It looks like he ran toward Frostmoon Farmstead. I need to follow him there."
"103224356-0-19354";"Rilyn is clearly mad. He murdered the others and now has plans on Raerana. I need to end this."
"103224356-0-19355";"A bystander saw some hooligans steal an old man's cane. He asked me to go help him."
"103224356-0-19356";"I need to investigate the valley in hopes of discovering some clue as to the strange events that occurred here recently."
"103224356-0-19357";"At the center of the valley sits a giant menhir. Lightning struck the stone as I approached, and the projection of an Altmer appeared. I should speak to her to see if I can learn more."
"103224356-0-19358";"As I approached the stone of the menhir, the projection of a female Altmer appeared. She needs my help to recover the Walking City. I'll search the valley's cave for the source of the projection."
"103224356-0-19359";"According to <<1>>, there are portals, or ""tears to Oblivion,"" located near the standing stones surrounding the great menhir in the valley. I can close them simply by touching them; quickly, before the Daedra stop me."
"103224356-0-19360";"Daedra emerged from the portal to defend the Oblivion tears, but I  succeeded in closing the portals. Now, I need to meet <<1>> in the cave to complete the ritual that she says will save the Walking City."
"103224356-0-19361";"The portal <<1>> opened brought forth a Daedroth! I need to kill it to save our lives, let alone Falinesti."
"103224356-0-19362";"Falinesti Summer Site still contains open portals from Oblivion, but the largest one is shut. Whether Falinesti is actually in Oblivion is anyone's guess. I should bid farewell to <<1>> and let her get on with her work."
"103224356-0-19366";"Once I'm disguised as a Reachman, I can more easily look around their camp."
"103224356-0-19368";"Rilyn has gone to the farmstead. I think Raerana is in danger. I need to protect her."
"103224356-0-19370";"I should talk to <<1>>."
"103224356-0-19373";"Now that Rilyn is dead, Raerana should be safe. I should check on her outside."
"103224356-0-19375";"I should talk to <<1>>."
"103224356-0-19377";"I have to defend the scout so she can lead me to the ritual site."
"103224356-0-19378";"With the Worm Cult taken care of, I should find <<1>>."
"103224356-0-19379";"I need to speak with Raz so that we can plan our next move."
"103224356-0-19380";"I should speak with Raz once more to end our business in Mathiisen."
"103224356-0-19381";"I need to board the Covenant ship and find the defecting officer."
"103224356-0-19382";"I've reunited Lakhazga with her husband, Moroth. Time to speak once more with Lakhazga."
"103224356-0-19383";"The chests buried around Horseshoe Island were filled with garbage. I should tell <<1>> the bad news."
"103224356-0-19384";"I should speak to Advisor Norion in the west warehouse."
"103224356-0-19385";"I should speak to Watch Captain Astanya at the docks."
"103224356-0-19386";"I should speak to Steward Eminwe in one of the warehouses to the east."
"103224356-0-19387";"I should look for the plans inside the warehouse."
"103224356-0-19388";"I should search for evidence of sabotage in the nearby storage areas."
"103224356-0-19389";"I need to seek out Advisor Norion by the south end of the docks."
"103224356-0-19390";"I should enter the warehouse and search for the stolen plans."
"103224356-0-19391";"I need to seek out Steward Eminwe at a warehouse on the north end of the docks."
"103224356-0-19392";"I should examine the nearby storage sheds for evidence of sabotage."
"103224356-0-19393";"I found the plans Advisor Norion spoke of. I should report back to him outside of the warehouse."
"103224356-0-19394";"I discovered some suspicious salted meats, possibly poisoned. I should return to Steward Eminwe back at the warehouse."
"103224356-0-19395";"I found the plans Advisor Norion spoke of. I should report back to him outside of the warehouse."
"103224356-0-19396";"I discovered some suspicious salted meats, possibly poisoned. I should return to Steward Eminwe back at the warehouse."
"103224356-0-19397";"Watch Captain Astanya has, somewhat rudely, directed me to speak with Watchman Heldil."
"103224356-0-19410";"I've encountered the Companion warrior <<1>> in the depths of the ruin. He suggested I read the <<2>> to see if there's a clue to the door puzzle."
"103224356-0-19419";"Raz is worried about being recognized in Mathiisen. He's asked me to meet with one of his agents, Fistalle."
"103224356-0-19420";"The note on Fistalle's body mentioned the forgemaster. Raz requested I search the forge for additional information."
"103224356-0-19421";"Malanie appears to lead the Heritance in Mathiisen. I should report this to Raz."
"103224356-0-19431";"I've joined up with the Orc officer, Lakhazga. She believes the Covenant's first move will have been to set up artillery. We need to destroy the artillery before we head to the lighthouse."
"103224356-0-19432";"We're inside. I need to find and defeat <<1>>."
"103224356-0-19433";"Lakhazga and I have done what we can. We should fight our way up to the North Beacon Lighthouse and find her husband."
"103224356-0-19434";"I should head inside and speak to this criminal."
"103224356-0-19449";"I've shown up in an unfamiliar place. The Prophet has appeared as a shade; I should speak with him and see where I must go next."
"103224356-0-19464";"It's done. The Divines have showed me the depths to which Estre has fallen. I should speak to Colaste one last time."
"103224356-0-19465";"I have all the relics. I'm sure Nenaron will want to know right away."
"103224356-0-19468";"I should speak to Watchman Heldil."

"103224356-0-19553";"Razum-dar has asked me to trust him, and do something seemingly foolish. I'm to openly accuse Malanie of treason in front of her men. I'll need to enter the barracks first."

"103224356-0-19561";"We've done it. Malanie and Condalin are dead. I should speak again with Raz outside the forge area."
"103224356-0-19569";"<<1>> asked for my help following through with their plans. If I can take commanders from the Gold Coast mercenaries out and blame it on the werewolves, their forces will be severely weakened, and focused on the remaing werewolves."

"103224356-0-19584";"I volunteered to help find the crew. She said Tanamo favors the tavern, Anala may be at the Fighters Guild, and Balithil is somewhere in the marketplace. Once I speak to them, I should see if they know where Degail is."
"103224356-0-19585";"I received a tip that <<1>> could be found near the western shore. I'll look for her there."

"103224356-0-19637";"Razum-dar indicated that I need to slip past the manor guards in order to get close to the Queen. He suggested I speak to one of his connections, Eshaba, in the market. I need to ask her about a souvenir of the First Auridon Marines."

"103224356-0-19705";"Malsia sought to open a portal to the Aetherius. It looks like she succeeded but the portal collapsed on her. Turning the skystones might reopen the portal, enabling her to return."

"103224356-0-19709";"Now that I've brought back the plant, I should tell <<1>> the good news. <<2>> says she's on the balcony of the Pilgrim's Rest Inn."

"103224356-0-19730";"Nilwen asked me to kill a beast called Greatclaw. She claims it killed a man by dropping a tree on him.\n\nShould I look for Greatclaw or report Nilwen in Ivarstead for squatting?"
"103224356-0-19731";"Once again, no great beast. Not sure what Nilwen's game is, but I'm going to find out."
"103224356-0-19732";"Nilwen insists Cracktooth, a ""fierce Goblin,"" will kill her if I don't intervene.\n\nNot sure if I should seek out Cracktooth or report Nilwen in Ivarstead."

"103224356-0-20740";"I bought <<1>>'s freedom. I should speak with <<2>> and make sure she doesn't plan to go back on the deal."
"103224356-0-20741";"I should search the nearby swamp for <<1>>'s belongings. She said they were probably hidden in tree stumps nearby."
"103224356-0-20742";"I think I've ""convinced"" <<1>> to forget about her former slave. I should speak with <<2>> before she leaves."
"103224356-0-20743";"I've agreed to return <<1>>'s stolen property to her. I should speak with her before she departs."
"103224356-0-20744";"I've collected <<1>>'s things from the dubious hiding spots in the swamp. She ran off almost immediately. I should bring her the trinkets and see what's got her so excited."
"103224356-0-20745";"<<1>> was by the boat she spoke of previously, but it seems the owner of the boat is here as well. I'll need to talk to both <<1>> and the Dark Elf to decide what to do next."
"103224356-0-20746";"I gave <<1>> to buy her freedom without stealing from her now-former master. <<2>> probably won't be happy about this turn of events."
"103224356-0-20747";"I think I've ""convinced"" <<1>> to forget about <<2>> and leave with her stolen items."
"103224356-0-20748";"I've agreed to return <<1>>'s stolen goods to her - both the trinkets and her slave, <<2>>."
"103224356-0-20749";"Something fishy is going on with <<1>>. She ran off when I asked her about the items she had me collect. I should follow her and find out what this is really all about."
"103224356-0-20752";"The Queen and I discovered a set of crystals blocking one of the doors. We'll each need to destroy one before we can enter the holy site."
"103224356-0-20753";"The Queen continues to lead the way. I should follow her."
"103224356-0-20766";"The crocodiles likely made short work of <<1>>'s pack guar. Perhaps her lost ruby is on one of their corpses."
"103224356-0-20767";"Wades-in-Muck didn't have Teegya's ruby, but she's now following me around, hoping for more berries. I need to keep looking for the ruby. Maybe a crocodile swallowed it."
"103224356-0-20769";"A crocodile swallowed Teegya's ruby, and I got it back the hard way. I should head back to <<1>> to let her know."
"103224356-0-20771";"I decided to push back against the Observer and take everyone out of the game. Now I have Angof and the mages at my side. I should speak to Angof and send them all to the Hollow City."

"103224356-0-20784";"I collected the wamasu lightning. I should return to <<1>> and give him the amulet."
"103224356-0-20785";"I told <<1>> I'd collect the wamasu lightning. I hope this amulet works."
"103224356-0-20789";"I just need to speak to Captain Erronfaire and my work for her should be complete."
"103224356-0-20793";"The dead guar were torn apart. Perhaps <<1>> fared better. I'll use the berries to lure her close. If she has the ruby, we can head back to Teegya."
"103224356-0-20797";"I decided to push back against the Observer and take everyone out of the game. Now I have Estre and the mages at my side. I should speak to Estre and send them all to the Hollow City."

"103224356-0-20819";"The shards of Alanwe's soul have been freed but now I must face the Daedric creatures, Ilambris-Athor and Ilambris-Zaven, who are keeping the shards of Alanwe's soul from reuniting."
"103224356-0-20820";"I survived the leap into the Tower of Lies. Now I should look for Skordo. Gwilir suggested that he'd be able to tell me what's going on inside the prison."
"103224356-0-20824";"Skordo wants me to rescue his three Fighters Guild companions: Sinfay, Borgath, and Vikord. He says they were taken by the ogrims and are being tortured."
"103224356-0-20825";"I rescued two of Skordo's companions, but the third one was dead when I found him. I should find Skordo and tell him what happened."
"103224356-0-20827";"The Fighters Guild members have escaped from the Tower of Lies and plan to regroup in the Hollow City. I should find Skordo, who wants to speak to me."
"103224356-0-20847";"The constable now says he's going to arrest the blacksmith for refusing to supply more weapons. Yet another person he's accusing of betrayal. I should go warn her of what he's planning."
"103224356-0-20850";"It sounds like <<1>> may be under the influence of some curse. I should go to his house and see if I can find any evidence to support my theory."
"103224356-0-20851";"The Dremora in the constable's house and this Daedric symbol would seem to confirm our suspicions. I should bring this back to Sabyssa and see what she thinks should be done next."
"103224356-0-20852";"There's a Khajiiti soldier on the beach of a small island outside of Haven. She may know what's going on."
"103224356-0-20854";"<<1>> wants to learn the pirates' plan so he can figure where best to strike. If I'm unable to eavesdrop on the pirates and learn their plans, I may be able to kill them and search their bodies for orders."
"103224356-0-20855";"<<1>> will bring what I found to <<2>>. If all goes according to plan, I will unlock the fort's front gates so the Speaker and his soldiers can make it inside."
"103224356-0-20856";"The old imperial Aquifer isn't completely deserted. If I can make my way through the aquifer and into the fort, I should be able to open the front gate so the Speaker and his soldiers can make it inside."
"103224356-0-20857";"The pirates' necromancers have already begun their ritual to animate <<1>>'s dead! I should make my way to the gatehouse so I can let <<2>> and his soldiers inside."
"103224356-0-20858";"I opened the gate, and <<1>> arrived with his soldiers. I should talk to the Speaker about his plan to stop the pirates' necromantic ritual."
"103224356-0-20859";"<<1>> will keep the pirates busy in the fort's courtyard. While he does so, I will slip into the Abandoned Fighters Guild and do what I can to stop the necromantic ritual."
"103224356-0-20860";"The pirate leader and her necromancers are in the middle of a strange ritual. I should stop them before the ritual completes!"
"103224356-0-20861";"The pirate leader is dead and her undead army disintegrated before me. I should inform <<1>> of my success."
"103224356-0-20862";"The pirate attack on <<1>> has failed. I should inform <<2>> that I defeated the pirate leader and her plan."
"103224356-0-20863";"<<1>> arrived with <<2>>, one of the Dominion's leaders. It seems he has a plan to retake <<3>> from the pirates. I should speak with some of the refugees to see if they know where he headed."
"103224356-0-20866";"<<1>> thinks <<2>> has been cursed. I should speak with <<3>> to see if I can lend a hand."
"103224356-0-20867";"The raiders have broken and are falling back. I still need to give the <<1>> to <<2>>, so he can begin making an antidote for the poisoned Orcs."
"103224356-0-20868";"<<1>> suggested talking to <<2>>. I should seek her help in questioning the Wood Orcs of <<3>>."
"103224356-0-20869";"I confronted <<1>>, and she revealed that <<2>> is behind the attacks. I should tell <<3>>."
"103224356-0-20870";"She suggested I investigate a nearby ruined Imperial tower."
"103224356-0-20871";"I killed <<1>>. <<2>> is well enough to speak. <<3>> has asked me to bring him the news directly."
"103224356-0-20873";"<<1>> suspects the ""curse"" looming over <<2>> is actually poison. I should seek out some items for him to test for traces of poison."
"103224356-0-20874";"I've found the items for <<1>>. I should give them to him and see if any of them are the source of the poison."
"103224356-0-20875";"The well water was poisoned with spider venom. I need to collect a venom sac from a broodmother spider in the nearby mine so <<1>> can create an antidote."
"103224356-0-20876";"I've collected the <<1>> for <<2>>. I should give it to him."
"103224356-0-20877";"<<1>> is under attack. <<2>> appears to be injured. I should see if he needs help."
"103224356-0-20878";"<<1>> is under attack. I should help fight off the raiding party."
"103224356-0-20882";"The refugees said <<1>> was last seen crossing the marsh toward the outer walls of <<2>>. I should see if I can catch up with him."
"103224356-0-20896";"Skordo says that Overseer Aruz, a powerful Daedra, has a key to a passage that leads up to the next level. We need to get that key. It should be in Aruz's chamber, which is just through the door where I talked to Skordo."
"103224356-0-20897";"I should search the camp and see if I can determine what happened to the Fighters Guild members who recently occupied the place."
"103224356-0-20901";"An old Imperial aquifer leads into <<1>>'s fort, where the pirates plan some sort of necromantic ritual. If I can find the aquifer, I can use the secret entrance against them."
"103224356-0-20902";"I should head into the woods and look for signs of the Fighters Guild members. The journal suggests that I start out by heading west and then southwest."
"103224356-0-20928";"At a campfire that was still burning, I found one of the Fighters Guild members. He was dead and Faraniel stood over his body. She claims she didn't kill him. I should talk to her and see what she knows."
"103224356-0-20929";"The best way to save the remaining Fighters Guild soldier is to follow the Shadow Walker runners. But to see these near-invisible Wood Elves, I need to collect the bark of a spriggan."
"103224356-0-20939";"<<1>> asked me to take her assistant <<2>> with me to search the Hall of Might for <<Ac:3>>."
"103224356-0-20940";"I found the entrance to a secret room! I should see where it leads."
"103224356-0-20941";"I should speak with <<1>> to find out what she wants."
"103224356-0-20942";"It seems <<1>> has been possessed by <<2>>, a Dremora bound to <<Ac:3>>. She used him to steal <<Ac:4>>! I should pursue her."
"103224356-0-20974";"After reviewing everyone's alibis with <<1>>, it looks like <<2>> has been lying. I should confront her."
"103224356-0-20975";"I collected spriggan bark, as Faraniel directed. Now I should bring the bark to her so she can tell me how to use it."
"103224356-0-20976";"If I touch the bark to a wisp of light, I should be able to see the Wood Elf runners. Faraniel told me I could pick up their trail on the other side of the bridge. Hopefully, they'll lead me to the missing Fighters Guild member."
"103224356-0-20977";"I found the Fighters Guild member. It looked like a lamia was protecting the Khajiit from a gang of Wood Elves. As I battled the Wood Elves, the Khajiit ran off. I should follow and talk to him."
"103224356-0-20978";"Sergeant Kamu was trying to get into the tower at the edge of this dark forest. Both the lamia and the Wood Elf claim to know how to get inside. I should decide which of the two to ask for help."
"103224356-0-20979";"Sergeant Kamu was trying to get into the tower at the edge of this dark forest. Both the lamia and the Wood Elf claim to know how to get inside. I should decide which of the two to ask for help."

"103224356-0-20981";"I should give the plans to a deputy in Koeglin Village."
"103224356-0-20995";"I need to find and release the three crewmembers the slavers are still holding here: <<1>>, <<2>>, and <<3>>. Captain Marck also asked me to kill Captain Angarthal."
"103224356-0-20997";"I should talk to Captain Marck now."
"103224356-0-20998";"I should relight the signal fire in the lighthouse."
"103224356-0-21004";"<<1>> suggested questioning the Wood Orcs of <<2>> to see if anyone appears to be guilty. I should question them, but the mine may hold evidence as well."
"103224356-0-21005";"I searched the mine and found a knife in a dead spider. I should ask <<1>> the blacksmith if she recognizes the blade."
"103224356-0-21006";"I confronted <<1>>, and she revealed that <<2>> is behind the attacks. I should tell <<3>>."
"103224356-0-21007";"It's very odd that <<1>>'s blade would be in a spider in the mine. I should confront her."
"103224356-0-21008";"I should keep an eye out for the missing inn workers. If I can protect them from the marsh's dangers, they should be able to get to safety."
"103224356-0-21009";"I sent all the inn's workers to safety. I should inform <<1>>, the inn's cook."
"103224356-0-21014";"<<1>> asked me to check in with <<2>>, a colleague of his who is exploring <<Ac:3>>."
"103224356-0-21023";"However, <<1>> seems concerned about something. She asked me to meet with her a short distance from camp."

"103224356-0-22151";"I found the hidden door that Naryu suggested was down here, but one of the levers that opens it is rusted shut. I need to find some grease to apply to the metal housing if I want to open this door."

"103224356-0-22287";"I need to speak to an Ordinator."
"103224356-0-22290";"A dark fire barrier is sealing the entrance to the temple. I was able to pass through the dark fire barrier that lead down here, perhaps I can do the same here? I should touch the barrier to find out."

"103224356-0-22337";"I returned the bag of goods to Feluz, but not his lucky pouch. He seemed ungrateful. He said to talk to his wife, Liane, about my reward."
"103224356-0-22338";"Liane saw me give Feluz his lucky pouch, and she isn't very happy about it. I should talk with her before I continue on my way."

"103224356-0-22439";"Lyris was always made to feel alone everywhere she went. Oblivion seems to have constructed a mockery of an event in her life, where Imperial troops would mock her and steal her armor."

"103224356-0-22466";"It seems the only escape now is victory. I must defeat the Lava Queen and take the Brimstone Crown."
"103224356-0-22467";"In order to begin the tour, I should go to the shrine of the Green Lady at the center of Deepwoods and talk with <<1>>."
"103224356-0-22468";"We've reached the next place important to the Green Lady's history. It's the waterfall outside the village.\n\nWe should be cautious, as there are still werewolves and Houndsmen around."
"103224356-0-22469";"We arrived at the archery range, where <<1>> will continue the story of the current Green Lady."
"103224356-0-22470";"I saw the waterfall and heard how Gwaering, the Green Lady, once saved herself and a companion from senche.\n\nThe next place to see is a nearby archery range."
"103224356-0-22474";"I heard the story of <<1>> and some its the key sites related to Gwaering and her selection as the new Green Lady. I should thank <<2>> for her time."
"103224356-0-22475";"Shazah has sealed the fort and needs to cast the final ritual at the central tree to drive out the Dro-m'Athra."
"103224356-0-22476";"Shazah is performing the final ritual to seal the fort. I should wait until her ritual is over."
"103224356-0-22478";"<<1>> is dead. <<2>> took his heartblood, as instructed by Hircine. I should follow her back to <<3>>."
"103224356-0-22482";"I should speak to <<1>> when I'm ready to help her with her heist."
"103224356-0-22483";"<<1>> has revealed what she plans to steal - Bhosek's records of incoming shipments and cargoes. She can sell this to King Fahara'jad for a great deal of money."
"103224356-0-22484";"The first step in breaking into Headman Bhosek's palace is to acquire a servant disguise."
"103224356-0-22485";"For a fee, one of Bhosek's servants told me where to get a disguise. I must retrieve it."
"103224356-0-22486";"I have the clothes to disguise myself as a servant. Now to put them on."
"103224356-0-22487";"I'm now disguised as a servant. I should be able to enter the palace without issue."
"103224356-0-22488";"We've landed on the island of Betnikh, the Spearhead's home port. I should talk to Captain Kaleen to ask about her plans."
"103224356-0-22489";"Headman Bhosek isn't inside the palace. I should ask around to find out where he is."
"103224356-0-22490";"A servant told me Bhosek is out back with female companions. If I'm to slip anything into his drink, I must do it outside."
"103224356-0-22491";"Headman Bhosek seems occupied with lady friends. As long as I look like a servant, it should be easy to slip Kaleen's powder into his cup."
"103224356-0-22492";"I've slipped Captain Kaleen's drug into Bhosek's drink. With luck, he'll pass out soon."
"103224356-0-22493";"I need Headman Bhosek's key to get into his lockbox."
"103224356-0-22494";"I have the key to Bhosek's lockbox, which is inside the palace, on the upper level."
"103224356-0-22495";"Bhosek's lockbox holds the shipping logs Kaleen needs to present to King Fahara'jad's envoy, as incriminating evidence against Bhosek. I have the key to open the lockbox, but now I need to find it."
"103224356-0-22496";"I found Bhosek's lockbox, but his guard is alert. I need to distract or disable him quietly before I can use the key."
"103224356-0-22497";"Headman Bhosek's lockbox is no longer guarded. I should take the shipping logs and be on my way."
"103224356-0-22498";"I have Bhosek's shipping logs, the evidence <<1>> wants to sell. I should find her at the docks."
"103224356-0-22499";"Captain Kaleen is waiting with King Fahara'jad's envoy. I must give her the shipping logs so we can get paid and leave the island."
"103224356-0-22500";"<<1>> will handle everything from here. When I'm ready to leave, I should follow her onto the Spearhead."
"103224356-0-22501";"<<1>> revealed our next stop: Betnikh, a small, Orc-controlled island. I should tell her when I'm ready to sail."
"103224356-0-22502";"We're bound for the Orc island of Betnikh."
"103224356-0-22505";"Neramo gave me a Dwemer device that should knock out the guard."
"103224356-0-22506";"The lockbox guard, Helthar, won't leave his post. Perhaps one of the other servants knows something about him."
"103224356-0-22507";"Helthar is terrified of fire. If I set a fire, it may drive him away from the lockbox."
"103224356-0-22509";"I should check the Ayleid warlord's remains to make sure the Worm Cult necromancers haven't raised him."
"103224356-0-22510";"A ghost rose from the warlord's remains, though it does not appear to be Ayleid. I should speak to it."
"103224356-0-22518";"Captain Lerisa is a master of disguise. Perhaps she can help with the servant disguise in the palace."
"103224356-0-22519";"Jakarn is a master thief. Perhaps he can get the key off Headman Bhosek."
"103224356-0-22520";"Neramo may be able to help me get the shipping logs out of Bhosek's lockbox."
"103224356-0-22521";"Lyris is unable to leave Oblivion due to sorcery that has separated her memories and made them manifest. I need to help heal her before we can leave."
"103224356-0-22522";"I should speak with the Silvenar to obtain a wedding invitation."
"103224356-0-22525";"Dusant suggested I deliver the Dresan Index to his friend, Valinwe, an evoker mage he was supposed to meet in Aldcroft."
"103224356-0-22526";"I collected evidence that suggests a young woman who was wronged by the Baelborne family now haunts the area. I should report back to Athel and tell him what I learned."
"103224356-0-22528";"I need to search the library in the Mages Guild in Daggerfall to see if I can find any books that reference ways to summon spirits and communicate with them."
"103224356-0-22529";"A cloaked man approached me as I perused a book on spirits. He seems to know a thing or two about the subject. I should talk to him."
"103224356-0-22532";"I need to find a good place within the Themond mine to bury Claudie's old belongings. That should summon her spirit to me."
"103224356-0-22534";"I should use the totem to see if it will grant me a vision."
"103224356-0-22535";"I should follow the Bloodthorn Cultist."
"103224356-0-22536";"The vision shows two Bloodthorn Cultists conversing. I should listen."
"103224356-0-22537";"The cultists spoke of Ayleid ruins. There may be another vision to observe."
"103224356-0-22539";"I need to find the Bloodthorn lair and learn more of their plans."
"103224356-0-22540";"I found their lair. I should try to find Vardan now."
"103224356-0-22541";"I should listen to Vardan discuss their plans."
"103224356-0-22543";"I should tell Laganakh of Vardan's plans."
"103224356-0-22544";"Lerisa has a disguise waiting for me at the entrance to the palace."
"103224356-0-22546";"I found Lyris's armor. I need to give it to her and see if it helps."
"103224356-0-22559";"I need to travel to the town of Silvenar to attend the wedding of the Silvenar and the Green Lady."
"103224356-0-22560";"I selected Khali to hold the Dark Mane. Shazah will be the next Mane. I should speak to her."
"103224356-0-22562";"I should find Rulorn. He may buy these parts from me."
"103224356-0-22563";"Rulorn wants me to help him activate a Dwarven sphere that he repaired using the parts I gathered."

"103224356-0-22569";"I need to talk to the Silvenar and find out how I can help him enter the city. <<1>> warned me against entering the city but I need to get to him soon."
"103224356-0-22571";"<<1>> would like me to lead him to  <<2>>."
"103224356-0-22572";"I need to find Saintsport's ""star"" to begin the trail of clues left by Captain Izad."
"103224356-0-22574";"I decided to help <<1>>, I should speak to him in his house."
"103224356-0-22575";"I need to speak to <<1>> one more time."
"103224356-0-22576";"I need to speak to Ezzag one more time."
"103224356-0-22577";"I need to speak to Kalari once more."
"103224356-0-22578";"Shuzura has instructed me to speak to Tazia to get a few pieces of gold for my troubles. I should speak to the Clan Mother's assistant."
"103224356-0-22579";"I should report to Captain Odreth."
"103224356-0-22584";"Shazah told me that there's a kind of dark ward on the temple door. To get inside, we'll have to cleanse several moonlight beacons around the temple grounds."
"103224356-0-22585";"I think I have everything Ongalion needs. I should return to his camp, and speak with him again."
"103224356-0-22586";"I cleansed the moonlight beacons around Moonmont. I should work with the Champions to dispel the ward on the temple door."
"103224356-0-22587";"Shazah cracked the ward open with an impressive display of magic. We should head inside."
"103224356-0-22588";"I found a locket while fighting the skeletons of the invaders. I think it belonged to Rosalind. Leon said she went to light the signal fire. I should do that next."
"103224356-0-22589";"Leon Milielle said I could lift the curse by reliving the last moments of his wife Rosalind's life. I should ask him how I should proceed."
"103224356-0-22590";"There is a rock wall nearby that Lyris has suggested she can break down."
"103224356-0-22593";"I should head out to <<1>>'s well and see about these rats."
"103224356-0-22594";"It seems that the well opens up into a cave. A Khajiit is crouched near where I dropped into the water, and hissed for me to speak with her."
"103224356-0-22595";"Tazia has suggested I might be able to shut down the laboratory and distract the skooma peddlers if I smash their laboratory tables."
"103224356-0-22596";"I smashed enough tables that this place should burn up quickly. Now I just need to light the fumes that are filling the cave."
"103224356-0-22597";"This place is filling up with smoke and fire. I should get out quick."
"103224356-0-22598";"I need to find Andewen and ask her how I can help at the Falinesti Autumn Site."
"103224356-0-22601";"I was told to destroy the corruption stones in order to gain entry to the root system of Falinesti, the Halls of Ichor. I can find the corruption stones among the caves the great city's roots have left behind."

"103224356-0-22603";"I've entered the deeper root system that was left behind by the city of Falinesti. I need to find Telenger somewhere in this mess."

"103224356-0-22606";"Telenger has teleported away, saying that the real trouble is at a Daderic temple he accidentally unearthed. I should try to find where he's gone in the tunnels."

"103224356-0-22610";"Mephala seemed to say that Telenger allowed her to claim part of the Falinesti Faithful as new cultists. I should talk to him about the situation."
"103224356-0-22611";"Telenger will seal the temple and teleport us outside before his spell takes complete effect. I should wait until he's finished."
"103224356-0-22613";"Now that we're at Telenger's camp, I should speak to him about what happened."
"103224356-0-22618";"I found the schematics by the remains of one of the unfortunate thieves. I should find Neramo and deliver them."

"103224356-0-22627";"I agreed to recruit Jakarn for Captain Kaleen's heist. He's trapped in a prison called the Grave beneath Headman Bhosek's palace. First I have to find the entrance."
"103224356-0-22629";"I collected <<mz:1>> from the Houndsmen. Now I need to talk to <<2>> and find out what the Silvenar needs me to do next."
"103224356-0-22632";"I defeated the guardian, at least temporarily. The Silvenar can now project his essence into the city. I should talk to his Psijic projection while the interval lasts."
"103224356-0-22635";"I should let Talres Voren know when I am ready to proceed."
"103224356-0-22636";"I should speak with Captain Odreth, the leader of the Vinedusk Rangers. He can tell me how I can help his unit out."
"103224356-0-22637";"I should use Glooredel's admixture to ignite the sap in the Vinedusk houses."
"103224356-0-22638";"I have primed the houses in the village. Time to meet up with Glooredel and ignite the village. She told me to meet her at her workshop in one of the large bulb houses, near the northwest edge of the village."
"103224356-0-22639";"I have primed the houses in the village. Time to meet up with Glooredel and light the place."

"103224356-0-22641";"Captain Odreth asked me to speak with Glooredel, his unit's alchemical engineer, about their plan to drive the Colovians out of the village."
"103224356-0-22652";"It seems <<1>>'s fears overcame him. I'll need to kill the beast alone."
"103224356-0-22655";"I agreed to help <<1>> prove he's not a coward. I should help him find his sword."
"103224356-0-22656";"Ezzag has asked me to investigate his field and discover who is stealing his crops."
"103224356-0-22659";"A group of bandits attacked me while I was in the field. They mentioned a cave nearby, and one of them ran off up the nearby trail. I should follow."
"103224356-0-22660";"I found where the bandits are hiding out. I should explore and see what I can find."
"103224356-0-22661";"A woman appeared at the far end of the cave and told me to stop fighting her people. I should speak with her and see what she wants."
"103224356-0-22662";"I think I managed to anger the bandit's leader. She wants me to ""see something."" I'm betting this is a trap."
"103224356-0-22663";"It was a trap. I'll have to kill <<1>>."
"103224356-0-22667";"Jakarn is by the exit to the Grave. I should talk to him."
"103224356-0-22668";"I should climb up to the upper level of the Grave and exit."

"103224356-0-22680";"Aniel has asked me to accompany her while she introduces me to the leaders of the Wood Elf and Khajiit groups at Thormar. She wants me to start with the Khajiit Yanabir-ja."
"103224356-0-22681";"I need to harvest poisoned stems from the stranglers growing around Thormar."
"103224356-0-22684";"I offered Kalari my help in understanding what's going on in her house. I should head inside."
"103224356-0-22686";"Sure enough, the house is full of what seem to be ghosts, but they're not attacking me. I should search the place to see if I can figure out what's going on."
"103224356-0-22687";"I found a hidden room behind a bookshelf on the second floor! Maybe I'll find some answers in here."
"103224356-0-22688";"Mathal may be behind this entire ""ghost"" scheme. Kalari thinks he might be hiding out in Rakhad's old house. I should confront him there."
"103224356-0-22689";"I found Mathal dead in the middle of some kind of ritual circle. This must be what's causing the ""ghosts"" to appear in Kalari's house. I need to stop the ritual."
"103224356-0-22690";"I need to tell Kalari what happened. Or do I? I could just lie to her and tell her Mathal has left town. I need to decide how to approach this."
"103224356-0-22691";"I should remember to use the Dark Poison on the stranglers before I kill them and harvest the stems."
"103224356-0-22699";"I defeated Mother Murk. I should head back to the northern wyress camp and tell Sibellec."
"103224356-0-22700";"I decided to give the ring to Jurak for a cut of his profits. I should talk to <<1>> one more time."
"103224356-0-22711";"The note said that if I find any Daedric artifacts, Aralyon the Scholar will pay handsomely for them."
"103224356-0-22712";"I found a Daedric artifact in Knife Ear Grotto. I should take it to Aralyon the Scholar. He's at the Daedric ruins east of Narsis."
"103224356-0-22713";"I need to fight my way past the dark spirits to retrieve Rid-Thar's ring."
"103224356-0-22714";"As I walked up on Jurak, I saw him arguing with a priestess of the lunar faith. It seems Jurak isn't a priest at all, but instead is a thief. I should decide how I want to proceed—give the ring to Jurak or to the priestess."
"103224356-0-22715";"I decided to give the ring to the priestess for safekeeping. I should talk to <<1>> one more time."
"103224356-0-22719";"General Godrun wants to break through the Ironhand ogres' lines and take the tower up above. He asked me to report to Sergeant Olfin to find out what I should do."

"103224356-0-22736";"I should speak to a House Redoran retainer named Lladrelo. I should be able to find him at Tal'Deic Fortress."

"103224356-0-22755";"Aniel's described some fun tricks we can play on the Wood Elves and Khajiit. To get started, I'll have to gather some poison from Dolirdor's pack and one of the Wood Elf rotmeth barrels."
"103224356-0-22756";"Now that we have some privacy from Dolirdor, Aniel wants to speak to me."

"103224356-0-22761";"Aniel wants me to worship Baan Dar before I enjoy the party. I must collect <<1>>s by using the <<2>> on chickens."

"103224356-0-22763";"I need to talk to <<1>>."
"103224356-0-22768";"I've returned to Reaper's March. I should speak to <<1>> in the ruins at Thormar."
"103224356-0-22776";"<<1>> made it back to the village. I should find out if she needs any more help."
"103224356-0-22777";"I should look for the owner of the shield. <<1>> is my best bet."
"103224356-0-22778";"I found the owner of the Nord shield, <<1>>, at the <<2>>. I should return the shield to him."

"103224356-0-22815";"I should find Gugnir in <<1>> and give him <<2>>'s crown."
"103224356-0-22817";"Gugnir fears <<1>> is preparing to attack <<2>>. Once I kill <<1>>, I should collect his crown as proof."
"103224356-0-22819";"Verrik is dead and King Casimir is safe. I should speak to King Casimir."
"103224356-0-22820";"I need to speak to <<1>> to understand what's going on in town."

"103224356-0-22824";"I've destroyed the circlet, as Raz wanted. Senalana has begun to crumble around me. Time to get out of here!"
"103224356-0-22825";"The scouts let me know that Eye of the Queen Razum-dar has led some troops into the vault. To get inside, I'll need to crack a ward on the entrance. I need to return a pair of welkynd stones to this entrance."
"103224356-0-22826";"I have the stones I need to get past the ward. Just need to place the stones back in the sconces near the entrance."
"103224356-0-22827";"I'll need to make my way through the vault to find the Queen's agent, Razum-dar."
"103224356-0-22828";"Raz wants me to get at the circlet, which I need to do by hitting a series of triggers in sequence."
"103224356-0-22829";"Raz has put a difficult choice on my shoulders. If I destroy the circlet, he'll die. If I take the circlet I'll free him, but he doesn't want that to happen."
"103224356-0-22830";"Razum-dar is alive and well in the Centurion's camp—and he looks very angry. I should speak with him."

"103224356-0-24563";"Abnur Tharn clawed his way out of the pit of darkness and his magic allowed me to strike down Mannimarco's projected form. I should speak to Abnur again."
"103224356-0-24564";"We must escape the castle before Mannimarco can reform and set his entire castle guard upon us."

"103224356-0-24844";"The plant died when I applied the Dominion's poultice. It would likely do the same to a living Hist tree. I should inform a Keeper of the Shell in <<1>>."

"103224356-0-24967";"<<1>> gave me a token to hand to <<c:2>>, a diplomatic envoy for the Dominion. This will let <<c:2>> know I can be trusted to assist him in this delicate matter."
"103224356-0-24968";"The assassin confessed that <<1>> ordered the deaths of <<c:2>> and <<Ac:3>> so they wouldn't be able to stop ""the tempest."" With such overwhelming evidence, I should confront the ambassador."

"103224356-0-24983";"I now possess a copy of the treaty. I should bring it to <<1>>."
"103224356-0-24984";"<<1>> can challenge Ambassador <<2>>'s claims with the copy of the treaty. I should bring it to him immediately. He and the Green Lady are staying at Ladrelas the armorer's house, located above the forge."
"103224356-0-24985";"<<1>> discovered the Maormer stole <<2>>'s copy of the treaty. He asked me to sneak inside the Maormer embassy and recover the stolen copy.\n\nI can't attack them head on - I'll need to use trickery."
"103224356-0-24986";"I let <<Ac:1>> kill <<2>>.\n\nI should let <<3>> know the ambassador won't trouble her town any longer."
"103224356-0-24988";"I should enter the Black Forge and try to find Vanus Galerion. The message suggested I go in through the side door."
"103224356-0-24989";"Vanus Galerion has been restored and has led me to the Great Shackle. I should speak to him and see what he thinks we need to do next."
"103224356-0-24990";"We should enter the temple courtyard and see what we can find of <<1>>."
"103224356-0-24991";"A skeleton spoke to us as we approached the temple courtyard."
"103224356-0-24992";"The skeleton warned us away, claiming <<1>> is being held inside the temple. <<2>> told me magical wards block the temple entrance. I should look for spider and scorpion emblems marking the wards so she can disrupt them."
"103224356-0-24993";"<<1>> destroyed the wards blocking entrance to the temple. We need to enter the temple's catacombs to search for her master."
"103224356-0-24994";"A strange barrier seals the door leading further into the temple. <<1>> thinks the cycle of both moons is key to breaking the seal."
"103224356-0-24995";"<<1>> fears her master is in grave danger. She urges caution as we proceed to the temple's central ruins."
"103224356-0-24996";"<<1>> appears to be possessed by a spirit named <<2>>, who plans to raise an undead army. Harming <<2>> would harm <<1>>. To avoid this, <<3>> and I must stop <<2>>'s summoning ritual."
"103224356-0-24997";"We stopped the summoning ritual, but <<1>> fled with <<2>>'s body. I should chase him while <<3>> recovers from her exertions."
"103224356-0-24998";"The water crystal once residing in the temple - the ""Mourning Stone"" - is key to sealing <<1>> back in his tomb. <<2>> thinks the only solution is to seal himself in the tomb, but <<3>> disagrees. I should ask her for her alternative."
"103224356-0-24999";"I decided to bring <<1>> with me to <<2>>'s tomb. While the spirit is distracted, I will seal them both away forever."
"103224356-0-25000";"I followed <<1>> into the temple's great hall, which is lined with deadly traps. I should find a way to disable the traps."
"103224356-0-25001";"<<1>> forced <<2>> out of his body and into a nearby tomb, but the solution seemed temporary. I should speak with <<1>> about making it permanent."
"103224356-0-25005";"<<1>> volunteered to seal herself in the tomb with <<2>> in place of her master. With little time before the spirit frees itself, I must decide who will be locked away with <<2>> forever."
"103224356-0-25006";"<<1>> and <<2>> are now sealed in the Tomb of the Waning Moons. I should speak to <<3>> before I depart."
"103224356-0-25014";"<<1>> and <<2>> are now sealed in the Tomb of the Waning Moons. I should speak to <<3>> before I depart."
"103224356-0-25015";"The Dark Elf mage I was talking to transformed into a Khajiit. I should talk to him and get more details about their strange malady."
"103224356-0-25016";"Zur the alchemist can craft a potion to get me past the rubble and into the laboratory, if I collect his notes and a rare tincture. They were scattered around the area when he accidentally blew up a Dwarven machine."
"103224356-0-25017";"I gathered Zur's materials. I should look for the entrance to the laboratory, where I hope to find him and Gadris."
"103224356-0-25018";"I should enter the laboratory and give the notes and tincture to Gadris or Zur. I'm not sure which one of the soul-melded mages will be available when I reach them."
"103224356-0-25019";"I need to wait for Zur to craft a potion that will temporarily reduce my size so that I can squeeze through a hole in the rubble and enter the Vile Laboratory."
"103224356-0-25020";"Zur completed the potion that will make me small enough to slip through a gap in the rubble and enter the Vile Laboratory. I should talk to the soul-melded mage and get the potion."
"103224356-0-25021";"The potion turned me into a monkey! Now I can squeeze through the rubble and enter the ancient Dwarven laboratory."
"103224356-0-25022";"I made it to the metallurgy workshop and reverted back into my normal form. Now I need to find Gadris's notebook."
"103224356-0-25023";"Gadris listed the items necessary to make the antipiodal rods. I need to gather refined void salts, a crystalline essence matrix, and ebony ore from somewhere in this workshop."
"103224356-0-25024";"I have the items from Gadris' notes, but he also mentioned a catalyst for the forging process. I should check to see if he left any notes on what this catalyst might be."
"103224356-0-25025";"According to Gadris' notes, corrupted blood would be the best catalyst for forging the antipodal rods. The experiment chamber should contain corrupted blood created by the Daedra. Some kind of monster guards the chamber, however."
"103224356-0-25026";"Now that I have the components and the catalyst to forge the antipodal rods, I should look for a furnace in the metallurgy workshop."
"103224356-0-25027";"Now I need to forge the melted components into the antipodal rods. There must be a weapon anvil around here that I can use."
"103224356-0-25028";"I forged the antipodal rods for the Dwarven device that the Soul-Meld Mage told me about. I should make my way to the Overseer's workroom and meet up with Gadris or Zur."
"103224356-0-25029";"I found a strange-looking Dwarven device. This should be the machine that can reverse the soul-meld and set Gadris and Zur free. I should talk to the mage and get any final instructions."
"103224356-0-25030";"The soul-meld is unraveling. The souls of the two mages have each been drawn to one of the antipodal rods. Now I need to pull one of the levers to save either Zur or Gadris."
"103224356-0-25031";"I decided to save Gadris. I should talk to him and see if he's recovered from the soul-meld reversal."
"103224356-0-25032";"I should meet Gadris outside the Vile Laboratory and speak with him."
"103224356-0-25033";"I decided to save Zur. I should talk to him and see if he's recovered from the soul-meld reversal."
"103224356-0-25034";"I should meet Zur outside the Vile Laboratory and speak to him."
"103224356-0-25036";"It was easy enough to recover Zadala's medicinal herbs. I should continue searching the riverbank for the scroll case."
"103224356-0-25044";"Now that I've reached <<1>>, I should give the supplies list to <<2>>."
"103224356-0-25047";"I found Kireth Vanos inside the gallery. She seems upset. I should speak to her."
"103224356-0-25050";"If neither is willing to produce a copy, I should inform <<c:1>>."
"103224356-0-25064";"I should take a stealthy approach in the warehouse if I hope to catch anyone off-guard."
"103224356-0-25065";"While in a warehouse, I discovered a Maormer sailor leaving a suspicious letter for an unknown recipient."
"103224356-0-25069";"I've found a suspicious listing of sales in an apothecary's ledger. It details the sale of a significant amount of Daedra blood to unknown customers."
"103224356-0-25070";"I found some Sea Viper paraphernalia on the Serpent's Kiss, a Maormer diplomatic ship. This shows a direct connection between the Maormer Embassy and the Sea Vipers in Shattered Shoals."
"103224356-0-25081";"Lady Clarisse Laurent told me that Telenger the Artificer discovered something important, but she couldn't remember what it was. I need to find Telenger."
"103224356-0-25082";"Raynor Vanos asked me to find Lady Clarisse Laurent. He's worried about her and figures I have the best chance of resisting the entrapment spell."
"103224356-0-25084";"Telenger's chamber is empty, but there's a note on the table. I should read the note and see what it says."
"103224356-0-25085";"I found Telenger the Artificer locked inside a vault on the library's lowest level. I should speak to him."
"103224356-0-25088";"Telenger the Artificer locked himself inside a vault on the lower level of the library in an attempt to slow the effects of the spell assaulting his mind. I should look for him there."
"103224356-0-25089";"Telenger the Artificer discovered a portal inside the library vault. There's something powerful and potentially useful on the other side. Telenger has unlocked the vault and asked me to join him inside."
"103224356-0-25092";"I entered the vault. I should talk to Telenger and see what he wants to do next."
"103224356-0-25094";"I came across a pedestal that holds a bright crystal of light. I think Telenger was right. I think that is one of the fabled Lights of Meridia."
"103224356-0-25095";"I stepped through the library vault portal and find myself on a floating rock high above the Library of Dusk. I should investigate the area and find the source of the power Telenger detected."
"103224356-0-25096";"Telenger the Artificer doesn't trust himself due to the Daedric spell that continues to asault his mind. He wants me to enter the portal and find the source of the power he detected on the other side."
"103224356-0-25097";"I obtained the Light of Meridia and need to get back to the surface. An image of King Laloriaran Dynar appeared before me and said that he will protect me if I choose to jump off the floating rock."
"103224356-0-25098";"I returned from the floating rock with a Light of Meridia. I should speak with Telenger the Artificer at their camp outside the library ruins."
"103224356-0-25099";"Now that Raynor has been freed from the Daedric spell, I should talk to him."
"103224356-0-25100";"Shalidor pointed out some kind of chest in the corner of the room. I should check it out."
"103224356-0-25104";"I have the three crystals that were powering portals around Eyevea. By placing them in the sconces out front of the Guildhall I should be able to help Shalidor crack that ward."
"103224356-0-25107";"In order to use the Wabbajack, I need to equip it."
"103224356-0-25112";"Inside the Black Forge, I found Vanus Galerion. At least, I found a part of the Great Mage. I should talk to the essence of the mage."
"103224356-0-25113";"Vanus divided himself into three fragments so that the Daedra couldn't use him to power the Great Shackle. To free the first fragment, Galerion's Health, I need to kill vampires and recover his stolen health."
"103224356-0-25114";"I freed the mage's essence of health. Now I need to go to the slave quarters and find the essence of stamina."
"103224356-0-25115";"I made my way to the slave quarters. Now I should find Galerion's essence and see what it has to say."
"103224356-0-25116";"Aelif followed me through the portal. She's set to lead me to Merric inside the Forge."
"103224356-0-25117";"Merric appears close to finishing the Prismatic Weapon. I should speak to him."
"103224356-0-25118";"Aelif believes Jofnir will know where Sees-All-Colors has gone, that they have some kind of connection. I should wait to see if her bet proves correct."
"103224356-0-25119";"I should follow Merric and Aelif into Oblivion in search of Sees-All-Colors."
"103224356-0-25125";"I took <<1>> into custody, preventing <<Ac:2>> from taking her revenge.\n\nI should let <<3>> know the ambassador won't trouble her town any longer."
"103224356-0-25126";"I took <<1>> into custody, preventing <<Ac:2>> from taking her revenge.\n\nI should let <<3>> know the ambassador won't trouble her town any longer."
"103224356-0-25130";"I should look for Falisa in the Inn in Sentinel."
"103224356-0-25133";"I found a small amount of moon-sugar in the Maormer embassy. I could use this to put the ambassador's guard to sleep."
"103224356-0-25135";"I found a love letter written by the ambassador's guard. I should forge a response from his love interest to get him to leave."
"103224356-0-25136";"Now that I've reached Cropsford, I should inform Bosekus of his brother's death."
"103224356-0-25137";"Now that I've reached <<1>>, I should find Wardiya."
"103224356-0-25141";"Now that I'm in Cropsford, I should bring the fertilizer to <<1>>."
"103224356-0-25145";"Sheogorath told me to take the book. Finally! Time to grab it and move on."
"103224356-0-25146";"I decided to use the note of debt to collect coin from <<1>>"
"103224356-0-25148";"I broke the barrier leading further into the temple, but <<1>> wants to speak with me before we proceed."
"103224356-0-25149";"Now that I'm in Cropsford, I should deliver the rag doll to <<1>>."
"103224356-0-25164";"Dominion scouts have been captured by the Daedra around Moonhenge. I should free them."
"103224356-0-25165";"I've rescued the scouts. I need to find their leader, Sergeant Galandir, and rescue him."
"103224356-0-25166";"I rescued Sergeant Galandir. I should talk to him to find out what happened at the Moonhenge."
"103224356-0-25167";"Sergeant Galandir explained that Captain Ethrel took the rest of the scouts through the portal, which the Daedra have since sealed. I must unseal the portal in order to rescue the Captain and her soldiers."
"103224356-0-25168";"I used the Daedric portal to enter Coldharbour. I should talk to Captain Ethrel or a member of her squad to find out what happened."
"103224356-0-25169";"According to the mage, the other members of Captain Ethrel's team scattered when Ethrel was wounded. I need to find them. I should also find the keys to the gateway that leads to this realm's Moonhenge, so that we can close the Daedric portal."
"103224356-0-25170";"I found the other members of Captain Ethrel's team. I should use the keys I found to unlock the pillars to the gateway that leads to this realm's Moonhenge."
"103224356-0-25171";"I reached this realm's Moonhenge. The sigil stone is defended by a guardian and crystals. Captain Ethrel's team will take care of the crystals while I fight the guardian."
"103224356-0-25172";"I reached this realm's Moonhenge. I should take the sigil stone so that the portal can be closed."
"103224356-0-25173";"The Daedric portal in Moonhenge is sealed. I should tell Sergeant Galandir of my success."
"103224356-0-25175";"There's a Khajiiti woman at the door to Gonlas' home. Perhaps I should talk to her?"
"103224356-0-25181";"<<1>> seemed shocked to learn of <<c:2>>'s death. She deputized me into <<Ac:3>> guard so I can help pursue the killer. I should examine the notes her guard has assembled of any suspicious activity in the city."
"103224356-0-25182";"I should see if any of the goods remain."
"103224356-0-25183";"Sind told me of a woman who apparently works directly for Hadran. She might know where Tand has gone. I should seek out this <<1>>."
"103224356-0-25184";"Now that I'm finally in <<1>>, I should bring <<2>> the letter."
"103224356-0-25186";"I've reached <<1>>. Now to find <<2>> and deliver his gifts."

"103224356-0-25218";"I gave the gate key to Malkur. I should follow him into the Hall of Judgment."
"103224356-0-25220";"The way out has been blocked by a shield spell. The rescued mages can disrupt the spell, but they need time to accomplish that. I should defend them while they work to open the gate."

"103224356-0-25242";"I found Laryaril, Pelidil's spy, badly wounded in the Old Imperial Prison. I should speak to her to find out what happened."
"103224356-0-25243";"To free Galerion's stamina, I need to recover the energy that was stolen and fed to the slaves. I can either convince the slaves to willingly return the energy, or I can use the Taskmaster's device to destroy them."
"103224356-0-25244";"I recovered the energy taken from Galerion's stamina. I should talk to the mage's essence and return the energy."
"103224356-0-25245";"The last fragment of Vanus Galerion's essences is trapped in the Foundry. I need to go there and free the essence of magicka."
"103224356-0-25246";"Galerion's magicka essence is being used to power the Foundry. I need to unlock the four seals of binding containing the magic that holds him in place."
"103224356-0-25247";"I released the seals that contained the magic holding Galerion's essence. I should talk to the mage's essence and see if it can break free."
"103224356-0-25248";"Now that I've collected all of Vanus' essences, I need to find the body of the Great Mage."
"103224356-0-25250";"According to dead man's journal, the rightmost bridge of Bthzark is secured by traps. The leftmost bridge has wards that will summon constructs unless I sneak past them."

"103224356-0-25303";"The lamia queen sent Tzik'nith ahead to open a passage to the tower. I should go northwest and meet up with her."

"103224356-0-29113";"It seems that I have been transported into a vision of the past by the spirit of General Dathieu. I should speak with the general to find out what's going on."

"103224356-0-29116";"Within the vision of the past, King Ranser insists that the magical packets worked as intended. He is now ordering his soldiers to charge the Orcs' ranks. He wants me to tell General Dathieu to make preparations."

"103224356-0-29129";"None of the mages survived, but the note also mentioned someone called Lucretia was looking for them. She might be in Longhaven, so I should look for her there."
"103224356-0-29130";"The note suggests a small group of mages came here to retrieve an artifact. I should look inside the cave and see if any of them survived. If not, I could still retrieve their signet rings and let someone in the guild know of their deaths."

"103224356-0-29191";"The <<1>>—<<2>>—wants nothing more than to be free of <<3>>. Perhaps I should speak with him."
"103224356-0-29200";"The Daedric Prince Azura spoke to me! She told me of <<1>>, a wizard who long ago attempted to enter the sealed ruins and recover <<2>>. I should search the <<3>> for the method she used to gain entry."
"103224356-0-29201";"Upon returning the <<1>> to <<2>>, the Daedric Prince seemed pleased. I should speak with her while I am able."
"103224356-0-29204";"It looks like two of the bandits' leaders may have killed each other over this issue. I found a letter from Thorzhul to Maaga claiming credit for Clan Agluk. There's another letter I should examine nearby."

"103224356-0-29222";"I stopped the ritual, though there was an unexpected twist - Draven tunrned into a werewolf. I should ask Kerbol what's going on."
"103224356-0-29223";"Kerbol's admitted the villagers' disease is lycanthropy. Disrupting Draven's ritual upset their control, which could turn all villagers into beasts. I need to tell Renoit what happened."
"103224356-0-29224";"Kerbol's prepared the initiation ritual for Draven to join him forever with the village. I need to get to the ritual site and see what exactly is going to happen, and put a stop to it."

"103224356-0-29228";"Kerbol asked me to help find Draven as it might still be possible to complete his initiation. Left incomplete, he will go mad and perhaps affect the other villagers. When I find him, I need to subdue him."

"103224356-0-29234";"Draven's incomplete link to the village puts everyone at risk. Kerbol wants me to lure him to the shrine at the top of the hill as the only way to sever his connection with the town is to kill him."

"103224356-0-29243";"Within the vision of the past, I have stopped the King's Guard from charging into the Orcs' ranks. I should now go and watch as General Dathieu confronts King Ranser."
"103224356-0-29256";"I've given the items for <<1>>. He said it would take only moments to determine if any of these objects are the source of the poison."

"103224356-0-29294";"The villagers have a secret all right, and at least part of it involves lycanthropy. No one could give me a straight answer. I should let Renoit know his concerns are real."
"103224356-0-29295";"The queen's handmaiden laid any doubts to rest. It seems Duke Renchant is planning to hand the city over to Imperial control. Glarikha asked me to find proof so we can present it to the queen."
"103224356-0-29297";"I reported my suspicious findings to Duke Renchant, but he has his own plan for saving the city. One of the clues I found points to a ship in the harbor known as the Bjoulsae Queen. I should investigate the ship."
"103224356-0-29298";"Duke Renchant is planning to hand Evermore over to Imperial control. The Bjoulsae Queen brought Imperial spies into the city. I need to follow the ship's captain and find out what else they're planning."

"103224356-0-29307";"I found Jonah Marose in a ruined tower, but we were immediately attacked by vampires. I need to defend the tower before I can talk to Jonah."
"103224356-0-29308";"Jonah is obviously nervous and afraid, and his mother doesn't appear to be at all well. He's convinced that he has some kind of connection to <<1>>, and he refuses to endanger Camp Tamrith. I should return and tell Captain Janeve about this."
"103224356-0-29309";"Countess Tamrith asked me to help treat the wounded soldiers while I ask them if they saw what happened to Captain Janeve during the vampire attack on the camp."

"103224356-0-29313";"I need to enter the cave and find <<1>>'s lair. If I hurry, maybe I can save Captain Janeve."
"103224356-0-29315";"I agreed with Captain Janeve. Just like Verandis and Gwendis, she deserves a chance to overcome and control the monster inside her. She deserves to live. Now I should head outside and find Darien and the others."

"103224356-0-29549";"Lleraya has placed an illusory veil over the ruins. It changes the topography and makes us see only what she wants us to see. Verandis believes the spell was specifically designed to hinder him. I should examine the tear and see if I can affect it."

"103224356-0-30562";"Lothson told me that of all the things they've lost, a necklace—a family heirloom—was the one that hurt Marien the most. He told me it's likely in the ruins known as Orc's Finger. If I get it back, it might give Marien the strength to go on."
"103224356-0-30564";"<<1>> asked me to recover a lost relic from the Tomb of Anahbi beneath the headquarters of Jode's Chariot in Redfur. <<2>>, their leader, holds the key to this trap-infested ruin."
"103224356-0-30565";"The evidence suggests the Dwemeri architect and the Ayleid princess were in love. When Urenenya fell ill, Klathzgar apparently placed her soul into a power crystal inside one of his centurions. I should recover Urenenya's soul gem."
"103224356-0-30566";"When I smashed her soul gem, the spirit of Urenenya appeared. I should speak to the spirit."
"103224356-0-30567";"I found the scholar Pelorrah's corpse deep within the ruins. I should examine his final research notes to see what he discovered."

"103224356-0-30573";"We've successfully executed the plan, but the vampire lord failed to show himself. I should regroup with the others and speak with <<1>> to determine our next step."
"103224356-0-30574";"After we fended off the feral vampire attacks in the middle of town, we realized the others had not rejoined us. <<1>> is checking the west gate for <<2>> while I check the east for <<3>>. I should hurry."

"103224356-0-30577";"The plan seems to have had unintended consequences. The Redguard's body is a burnt husk, and <<1>> has returned without <<2>>. I should talk to him to see what he found."
"103224356-0-30578";"As I spoke to <<1>> regarding our missing comrades, <<2>> reappeared with information regarding the vampire lord."
"103224356-0-30579";"After discovering the <<1>>'s body, <<2>> appeared to direct us to the vampire lord's lair before running off again. <<3>> and I should make our way there as soon as possible to help him."
"103224356-0-30581";"<<1>> and I have discovered the vampire lord's lair, but <<2>> has been turned and enthralled. We must destroy them both."

"103224356-0-30596";"Lady Laurent apparently considers me her new assistant. She's sent me to find where her previous assistant, Stibbons, put her alchemical supplies."
"103224356-0-30597";"I've retrieved Lady Laurent's alchemical equipment from her camp. I should deliver it to her to get this expedition going."
"103224356-0-30598";"Lady Laurent wants to complete her studies on the Yokudan ruins, and has asked me to keep a look out for her stolen alchemical reagents. The Goblins probably took them."

"103224356-0-30604";"Lady Laurent's plan is to use the stoneflesh potion on the Goblins. This should provide her test subjects so she can figure out the antidote. I should add the potion to the Goblins' food."

"103224356-0-30608";"Now that Lady Laurent has recovered her notes, I should ask her about her plans for de-petrifying her assistant."
"103224356-0-30609";"Now that Lady Laurent has the final clue for the stoneflesh antidote, she needs to get her hands on a piece of gargoyle flesh—specifically, the tongue. I should help her by taking one down."
"103224356-0-30610";"I should follow Lady Laurent back to her ransacked camp."
"103224356-0-30611";"Lady Laurent has all the ingredients she needs for the stoneflesh antidote. I should see if she needs anything else before making it."
"103224356-0-30612";"Lady Laurent has to figure out the actual formulation for the stoneflesh antidote, so she's sent me with several formulas to use on petrified Goblins."

"103224356-0-30618";"Lady Laurent was undismayed by the failure of her antidotes, and believes she has enough information to make a working one. I should wait and see if she's correct."
"103224356-0-30619";"I've used all the antidote formulations on petrified Goblins. I should let Lady Laurent know that none of them seemed to work."

"103224356-0-30628";"The scholar Pelorrah discovered that Klathzgar was constructing a centurion as a gift to Princess Urenenya. I should search for signs of what happened to the scholar."
"103224356-0-30629";"Adusa wants me to acquire the list of targets for her. I can find it on someone named Rasaba the Keen. Whether Rasaba lives or dies is entirely up to me."
"103224356-0-30630";"I acquired the list of targets. I should return to Adusa at Ravenwatch Castle and let her see who the Montclairs plan to assassinate."

"103224356-0-30633";"We're inside the castle and ready to defend it against the assassins. I need to make sure that Adusa survives this assault."
"103224356-0-30634";"With Rohlbert dead, the Montclair forces troubling Shornhelm shouldn't cause many more problems. I should speak to Adusa and make sure the threat has been eliminated."
"103224356-0-30635";"We're inside the manor house. Now we need to find Rohlbert and end this Montclair threat."
"103224356-0-30636";"Adusa believes Rohlbert is hiding in the old Montclair Manor, in Shornhelm's upper city. I should meet her in front of the manor house."
"103224356-0-30637";"Meva told me the group failed to put an end to the Dark Anchor because it was being empowered by strange devices. I should see what Danys has to say about this."
"103224356-0-30675";"The Dwemeri architect and the Ayleid princess were in love. When Urenenya fell ill, Klathzgar placed her soul into a power crystal within one of his centurions. I should take Urenenya's soul gem back to her family's castle in the Silaseli Ruins."
"103224356-0-30676";"The Dwemeri architect and the Ayleid princess were in love, and Klathzgar placed her soul into a power crystal within one of his centurions. I've brought the soul gem back to the Silaseli Ruins, and should now smash it to release her soul."

"103224356-0-30680";"I destroyed the dark anchor in the courtyard and it seems the battle is over; we've retaken Bangkorai Garrison. King Emeric and Queen Arzhela are coming down to address the troops. I should listen to what they have to say."
"103224356-0-30684";"With the Fangs destroyed, the Dark Anchor is now no more powerful than the rest. If I can fight back the invaders brought forth from Coldharbour, I should be able to shut down the Anchor and close the gateway."
"103224356-0-30685";"Lothson said he and Marien were hoping to start over in Shornhelm. Now that I have the necklace, I should find him in the city."

"103224356-0-30697";"The note from the bottle has cryptically directed me to find a spy near the main entrance to Pa'alat. But I'm not supposed to mention the note or the spy will have nothing to do with me."
"103224356-0-30698";"I found a mysterious note inside the suspicious bottle. I should read it and see if it says anything important."

"103224356-0-30713";"Thanks to the influence of the sleeping draught, Bailiff Sagabar is now passed out in his room. I should go in and search for clues as to where they're holding the hostages."
"103224356-0-30714";"I should go to the old mill south of town and rescue the hostages. A thug named Bulzog is guarding them."

"103224356-0-31227";"The stablehand said I could find people to give the weapons to in the town square. He disguised them as nondescript packages, so even if the Imperials stop me, they shouldn't be alerted to what I'm up to."
"103224356-0-31228";"After passing out weapons in the town square, a beggar grabbed my attention. I should see what he has to say."

"103224356-0-31237";"Qismah's husband arrived to find me digging about in his personal effects. I should confront him to see if he's really the traitor of Hallin's Stand."
"103224356-0-31238";"Dhakir, Qismah's husband, said he wasn't the one responsible for the city's betrayal. But he can't divulge any more information, because his daughter is being held captive by an Imperial in order to buy his silence."
"103224356-0-31239";"After leaving the at-Nimr's home, the same beggar I spoke to earlier found me. I should ask him what he knows about the at-Nimr family."
"103224356-0-31240";"Dhakir said he can't divulge any more information, because his daughter is being held captive by an Imperial in order to buy his silence. I should find the pavilion where the beggar said she was being held."
"103224356-0-31241";"Dhakir said he can't divulge any more information, because his daughter is being held captive by an Imperial in order to buy his silence. But if I can free his daughter, he'd be free to tell me whatever he knows."
"103224356-0-31242";"I've freed Hazzi from the Imperial soldier. I should follow her, since she's probably going straight to her father, Dhakir."
"103224356-0-31243";"Overwhelmed by the safe return of his daughter, Dhakir told me the Imperials plan to publicly execute the grandeya of Hallin's Stand, and gave me a key to free her. I should take this information to Yarah at the alchemist's shop."
"103224356-0-31244";"I've lit the watchtowers, and now the people of Hallin's Stand are ready. Ufa is here as well. I should speak to him to find out how he wants to proceed."
"103224356-0-31245";"<<1>>, <<2>>, and <<3>> caught the traitor after he opened the gates to the Imperials, but it was too late. Now, these guards are hiding somewhere in the city. I need to find them."
"103224356-0-31246";"According to the soldiers who caught the traitor, <<1>> is in hiding. The only way to root him out would be to use one of his vices - beautiful women.\n\nI should speak to <<2>>, the courtesan the soldier mentioned."
"103224356-0-31247";"The courtesan was at first unwilling to set a trap for the traitor, but she was startled to see Ufa alive. I should speak to him and see what he thinks we should do next."
"103224356-0-31248";"Ufa said to prevent bloodshed, we should incapacitate the traitor Maradem before confronting him. He said I could find the means for that at the Mages Guild by speaking to a man named Razin."
"103224356-0-31249";"<<1>> told me to lace a special bottle of wine with the powder I've brought, so she can serve it to the traitor."
"103224356-0-31250";"I've obtained the paralyzing powder from the apothecary. I should take it to the Drowsy Owl Inn, where Niha works."
"103224356-0-31251";"Now that the courtesan has served the traitor the paralyzing agent, I should question him."
"103224356-0-31252";"I've gotten all the information I can out of the traitor. Ufa's just arrived - I should see what he plans to do next."
"103224356-0-31253";"Now that the poison's paralysis has taken full effect, Ufa asked me to search Maradem for any information of use."
"103224356-0-31254";"With the key to the stocks I'll be able to free the grandeya from her bonds in front of the palace. I should go there immediately."
"103224356-0-31255";"With the key to the stocks I'll be able to free the grandeya from her bonds in front of the palace."
"103224356-0-31256";"The grandeya, free but weak from her captivity, asked me to light the signal fires atop the two watchtowers to call the citizens to arms."
"103224356-0-31257";"I've lit the watchtowers, and now the people of Hallin's Stand are ready. Ufa is here as well. I should speak to him to find out how he wants to proceed."
"103224356-0-31259";"With Ufa guarding the palace entrance, I should be able to enter the grandeya's palace and put an end to the Imperial occupation."
"103224356-0-31260";"I've found the leader of the Seventh Legion within the grandeya's palace. She seems oddly calm - I should speak to her and find out why."
"103224356-0-31263";"The Imperial leader was buying time for her lackey, Maradem, to show up. I can put an end to this Imperial occupation by defeating him and slaying Secundus."
"103224356-0-31264";"Secundus is slain, and with her, the army occupying Hallin's Stand will fall. Even now, Ufa's conscripts are retaking the town. I should leave the palace and see how they fare."
"103224356-0-31265";"The grandeya has reclaimed her seat of power in Hallin's Stand, and with so, the city. She's addressing the crowd outside the palace. I should listen to her speech."
"103224356-0-31266";"Ufa's forces are scattering the Seventh Legion, retaking Hallin's Stand. I should ask him how things are going."
"103224356-0-31267";"I must enter the Crypt of Lamae Bal."
"103224356-0-31268";"I should talk to Rahaja."
"103224356-0-31278";"I have the key and know where to find the smuggler tunnels. I should swim back to the coast and head for the cove."
"103224356-0-31280";"We've located <<1>>, who is trapped in a web. Freeing him may attract the spider who created these large webs, so I should be ready for anything."
"103224356-0-31283";"I should speak to First Mate Elvira Derre at the Northpoint docks. She should be prepared to offer me passage to Sentinel."
"103224356-0-31288";"We've arrived at the docks in Sentinel. I should speak with Elvira to find out what's going on."

"103224356-0-31300";"Heads in tow, we can now begin the ritual—so <<1>> can swear her oath to Malacath."
"103224356-0-31308";"<<1>> is in the <<2>>. He must be defeated for <<3>>'s oath to be fulfilled."
"103224356-0-31327";"I agreed to help <<1>> find her pet bantam guar, Puddles. But I need to find a day-old fish first. I should talk to Grubdosh or get an old fish from the docks."
"103224356-0-31330";"We arrived at the vault. I should speak with Sai to see what's next."
"103224356-0-31331";"<<1>> must now swear her oath to of vengeance to Malacath."
"103224356-0-31332";"I need to find a courier in Shornhelm before I can begin my investigation. Adusa told me to start at the west gate."
"103224356-0-31333";"I should follow the courier through Shornhelm to see who he makes contact with. I can't let him out of my sight."
"103224356-0-31336";"I need to let Baron Dorell know what happened inside the manor. And I need to pass along the orders Verandis projected to me."
"103224356-0-31337";"The smuggler's tunnel is located in a cave beneath the lighthouse. Skordo suggests we enter the tunnel one at a time so as not to draw any suspicion."

"103224356-0-31342";"To enter the Chamber of Passage and rescue King Emeric from Imperial Magus-General Septima Tharn, I need the blessing of heroes' spirits. I should speak with the spirit of Divad Hunding."
"103224356-0-31350";"Izzara needs to weave an enchantment to destroy the spell key. I must wait for her to complete the spell."
"103224356-0-31354";"The courier tossed a coin into the town square fountain before leaving by the south gate. I could pick up the coin and head back to Adusa, or I could wait to see if the informer shows up to collect the coin."
"103224356-0-31355";"I picked up the courier's coin from the fountain. Adusa will want to see this. I should return to her where I first spoke to her, in the upper city."
"103224356-0-31356";"The courier's coin was meant for <<1>>, making him the prime suspect in my investigation. I should search his house for evidence connecting him to the Montclairs."
"103224356-0-31357";"Adusa found a coded message on the coin. She suggested I speak to her friend Sahil, at the inn. He should be able to decipher the message for me. Then I can find the location of the informer."

"103224356-0-31359";"I found <<1>> trapped in some sort of energy barrier. He thinks I can break the barrier by using a watcher's central eye to interrupt the flow of energy."
"103224356-0-31361";"We found a safe building to use as our base of operations in Northpoint. I should talk to Skordo and find out what he thinks we should do next."
"103224356-0-31362";"I need to search the city and find Baron Dorell, Countess Tamrith, and Darien. They were supposed to follow after us. Once I locate them, I need to lead them back to the safe house."
"103224356-0-31370";"Apostle Marian revealed that the entity in the ruins is a Nereid named Lorelia. She says the Primeval Seekers misled me and have been capturing Rain Disciples. She asked me to find and free the captured disciples."
"103224356-0-31371";"A watery voice spoke when I took the essence to the essence troughs. The voice spoke of having nearly enough essences for some purpose. The voice also mentioned a name—Apostle Marian. I should look for this apostle."
"103224356-0-31380";"To enter the Chamber of Passage and rescue King Emeric from Imperial Magus-General Septima Tharn, I've earned the blessings of the heroes' spirits. Now I must simply find the entrance to the chamber."
"103224356-0-31381";"<<1>> asked me to speak with <<2>>, an expert on <<c:3>>."
"103224356-0-31384";"I found all of the members of the assault team and sent them to the safe house. Now I should return there so we can plan our next steps."
"103224356-0-31385";"Everyone seems to have made it to the safe house. I should talk to Skordo and find out what's going on."
"103224356-0-31386";"Skordo wants to find the source of the sounds the Countess heard coming from the inn. Luckily, Darien acquired the key while he was exploring the city. I need to go upstairs and get the key."
"103224356-0-31387";"I have the key that unlocks the inn. Now I need to go the inn and see what's waiting inside. If it's survivors, I need to send them back to the safe house. If it's Lleraya, I have to kill her before she can use her magic to charm me."
"103224356-0-31392";"I should head to <<c:1>> and speak with Conservator <<2>>."
"103224356-0-31393";"I need to activate both pillars next to <<c:1>>. To do so, I will need to use <<2>>."

"103224356-0-31397";"Baron Dorell and I have made it into the inn. Now we need to search the building and see if we can find either Lleraya or any Northpoint survivors."
"103224356-0-31402";"I could speak to this Haskill person, ask about the place I've come to, before I move on."
"103224356-0-31403";"<<1>> has attuned me to the past and placed me in the role of <<2>>, one of the elves we observed in <<3>>. I should search <<4>> and discover what his purpose was here."
"103224356-0-31404";"I have located the <<1>>, the apparent goal that <<2>> was heading for. I should try to destroy it, and anyone that tries to prevent me from doing so."
"103224356-0-31405";"After I used the Prismatic Weapon to disrupt the <<1>>, it vanished, as Molag Bal's voice echoed in the room. <<2>> has appeared. I should talk to her about what we witnessed."
"103224356-0-31406";"I should go to the Earth Forge and meet <<1>>. Together we need to follow the ancient instructions we found in <<2>> and create a weapon that can defeat the <<3>>, should Molag Bal attempt to use it against Tamriel again."
"103224356-0-31408";"The Baron and I found Northpoint survivors hiding in the inn's attic. One of them emerged to speak to us. I should talk to him."
"103224356-0-31409";"Now that I know Lleraya occupies Dorell Manor and I have a key, I need to go to the manor house and slip inside."
"103224356-0-31410";"Before I confront Lleraya, I should locate Lord Ellic Dorell and make sure he's still alive."
"103224356-0-31411";"I've done as Glorthorien wished, and her son has appeared at the falls. I should speak to him and see what he has to say."
"103224356-0-31412";"I activated the pillars. I should speak with <<1>> and see what I need to do next."
"103224356-0-31414";"<<1>> told me to place <<Ac:2>> within <<Ac:3>>. Doing so should fully activate <<c:4>>."
"103224356-0-31417";"<<c:1>> of <<2>> seems to be opening … something it hasn't done in centuries. I should wait to see exactly what is happening."
"103224356-0-31418";"<<1>> trapped us and entered <<c:2>>! <<3>> said I should use <<4>> to free myself."
"103224356-0-31419";"<<1>> emerged from <<c:2>> as a monster! He appears to be filled with rage. I need to stop his rampage before he kills everyone in the room, including <<3>>!"
"103224356-0-31422";"<<1>> is dead. I should speak with <<2>> about her intentions."
"103224356-0-31423";"<<1>> insists she must enter <<c:2>>, despite the dangers. I should wait for her emergence to see whether she will be ratified, or suffer a similar fate as her brother."
"103224356-0-31424";"I have arrived in <<1>>. I should speak with <<2>> to learn more about this place."
"103224356-0-31427";"I located Lord Ellic Dorell. I should talk to him and see if he can tell me what's going on in here."
"103224356-0-31428";"Lord Ellic has definitely gone mad, but at least he was able to tell me that Lleraya is upstairs. I should go up there and find her."
"103224356-0-31433";"With the vial of blessed water in hand, I should travel southwest to the falls that overlook Gil-Var-Delle. There I must drip some of the water at the crest of each of the falls."
"103224356-0-31434";"All of the carnival's performers have what they need to please the crowds. I should inform <<1>>."
"103224356-0-31435";"I defeated Septima Tharn, rescued the king's soul from the Far Shores, and restored him to life. I should speak with King Emeric about everything that happened."
"103224356-0-31439";"First I must fill a vial from the waters at the shrine."
"103224356-0-31441";"Verandis appeared to warn me that I was succumbing to Lleraya's spell. He said she's using a veil, like the one she cast at Lorkrata. I need to head into the basement and see if I can find a way to break her spell."
"103224356-0-31442";"I was able to use a tear in Lleraya's veil to break free from her spell and see beyond the illusion. Now I need to deal with Lleraya while I have the chance."
"103224356-0-31443";"Now that Lleraya has been defeated, Verandis has appeared before me as a magical projection. I should talk to him and see what he suggests I do next."
"103224356-0-31446";"I decided to expose <<1>> as the informer.  I should return to <<2>> in the upper city to debrief her."
"103224356-0-31447";"I found a codebook in <<1>>'s house in Shornhelm, implicating him as the informer, but <<2>> saw me going through her home. I should explain myself to her."
"103224356-0-31449";"Before Nyronie left, she told me how I can track the aspects. I can track the wolf by its prints, the bear by crouching and seeking the damage it left behind, and the hunter by finding his camp."
"103224356-0-31450";"The illusion of the veil has fallen and the nobles are once again visible in the manor. I should talk to Lord Ellic Dorell and see if everyone is all right."
"103224356-0-31451";"Imperial Magus-General Septima Tharn has captured King Emeric and taken him to the Chamber of Passage within the Hall of Heroes. To enter the chamber, I must speak to heroes' spirits and gain their blessing. I should begin with Frandar Hunding."
"103224356-0-31452";"Imperial Magus-General Septima Tharn has captured King Emeric and taken him to the Chamber of Passage within the Hall of Heroes. To enter the chamber, I must speak to heroes' spirits and gain their blessing. I should begin with Frandar Hunding."

"103224356-0-31454";"I should speak with <<1>> about <<2>>'s delayed shipment."
"103224356-0-31455";"<<1>> claimed <<2>>'s shipment was dumped outside of town. I can claim it if I can find it."
"103224356-0-31458";"<<1>>'s missing shipment was infested with kwama from <<2>>. I should bring him what's left of the shipment."
"103224356-0-31461";"<<1>> asked me to deliver the shipment directly to <<2>>."
"103224356-0-31462";"It turns out that <<1>> is not only an alchemist, but a hag … an actual hag. She wants me to put the contents of the shipment in her <<z:2>>."
"103224356-0-31468";"I must wait for <<1>> to cure me."
"103224356-0-31469";"I should search Torog's Spite for a letter or something that might show which clan is responsible for the bandits' raids."
"103224356-0-31471";"To enter the Chamber of Passage and rescue King Emeric from Imperial Magus-General Septima Tharn, I need the blessing of heroes' spirits. I should speak with the spirit of Divad Hunding."
"103224356-0-31472";"<<1>>, one of the Vinedusk, appeared out of a portal. He asked me to step through to their base of operations."
"103224356-0-31474";"I should speak with  <<1>> near Cormount to open a portal."
"103224356-0-31481";"<<1>> said I should speak with her performers to get more details."
"103224356-0-31482";"I spoke with <<1>>'s performers. Each told me what they need in order to perform for the locals."
"103224356-0-31483";"<<1>> needs supplies from the docks of <<2>>. I should look for an ornate chest."
"103224356-0-31484";"<<1>> needs <<mz:2>>. I should search the beaches of <<3>>."
"103224356-0-31485";"<<1>> needs a book on Wood Elf folklore. He suggested I speak with <<2>> in the <<3>> Mages Guild."
"103224356-0-31487";"The supplies for the Khajiit Embassy were unusable. I should continue my investigation of <<1>>."
"103224356-0-31488";"I stepped through <<1>>'s portal to what seems to be an old ruin. There doesn't appear to be a way out. A Vinedusk named <<2>> asked me to speak with him."
"103224356-0-31490";"I found several Ayleid fragments that might be what Eminaire is looking for. I should bring them to her back at her camp."
"103224356-0-31492";"<<1>> is dead. I should tell <<2>>."
"103224356-0-31496";"<<1>>, a Vinedusk Ranger loyal to <<2>>, believes <<3>> may have ordered the attack on the work party before fleeing to <<c:4>>. He asked me to meet him there."
"103224356-0-31497";"To enter the Chamber of Passage and rescue King Emeric from Imperial Magus-General Septima Tharn, I need the blessing of heroes' spirits. I should speak with the spirit of Makela Leki."
"103224356-0-31498";"To enter the Chamber of Passage and rescue King Emeric from Imperial Magus-General Septima Tharn, I need the blessing of heroes' spirits. I should speak with the spirit of Makela Leki."
"103224356-0-31502";"I can either find Rahaja and become a vampire or look for a priest of Arkay and receive the cure."
"103224356-0-31503";"After learning that the Nereid is only trying to save the lake, I rescued some of her disciples from Primeval Seekers. The Seekers' leader, Herald Kixathi has approached me. I should speak with her."
"103224356-0-31505";"I delivered the <<z:1>> to <<2>>, a seemingly friendly hag."
"103224356-0-31507";"Nicolene said Captain Kaleen was meeting a contact named Sigil on the road leading out of Shornhelm. Sigil was supposed to give her more information about Naruk. I should start my search on the road out of Shornhelm."
"103224356-0-31508";"I found Captain Kaleen's contact, Sigil, off the road. Kaleen is nowhere to be seen. I should see what Sigil has to say."
"103224356-0-31509";"""Sigil,"" Captain Kaleen's contact, suggested I speak to the Shornhelm guards. She hopes one of them may have seen Captain Kaleen. I should start with the Gate Captains since they see everyone who comes and goes from the city."
"103224356-0-31510";"Naruk is with Kaleen and was described as being angry. Kaleen may need my help. Perhaps someone else in town has seen them. I should ask around, starting with people on the streets. Maybe a beggar has seen them."
"103224356-0-31511";"Naruk and Kaleen entered an abandoned house and did not come out. I should look around inside for any evidence that might lead me to them."
"103224356-0-31512";"Sigil and I found a trap door in the abandoned house. The trap door is locked, but Sigil has volunteered to get it open."
"103224356-0-31513";"Sigil opened a trap door and then headed down immediately afterward. She will need help if Naruk is waiting below."
"103224356-0-31515";"Our search of the abandoned house revealed a hidden basement behind a trap door. Captain Kaleen may be down here, if she's still alive."
"103224356-0-31516";"Nicolene must have followed us into the basement. I'd better wait to see how this reunion plays out before attempting to speak with Captain Kaleen."
"103224356-0-31517";"Now that Captain Kaleen is feeling a bit better, I should speak with her. She might be able to tell me where to find Naruk."
"103224356-0-31518";"Naruk's lackey, Abante, revealed that Naruk has already fled from the hidden basement where I found Kaleen. Kaleen explained that he intends to release poison in the cistern behind the Fighter's Guild in order to poison Shornhelm."

"103224356-0-31522";"I need prevent Naruk from completing his plan to poison Shornhelm and incite old hostilities within the Covenant. To do this, I should seal the cistern gates and destroy the barrels of poison. Then I need to kill Naruk so he can't try again."
"103224356-0-31523";"Naruk is dead and the plot to poison Shornhelm has been dealt with. I should go to the Dead Wolf Inn and meet up with Captain Kaleen and Nicolene to make sure their aren't any loose ends."

"103224356-0-31545";"The relic is gone—along with most of the Doomcrag! I should talk to Darien and make sure everything is all right."
"103224356-0-31548";"From reading Septima Tharn's research notes in her private office in Hallin's Stand, I learned that she is planning something foul at the Hall of Heroes. I should go there next to look for her."

"103224356-0-31553";"I've found the remains of both scholars who went missing, and retrieved notes from their camp. I should return to <<1>> with the research."

"103224356-0-31561";"Princess Elara has completed the ritual to become the new Viridian Sentinel. I need to return to the altar with Elara."
"103224356-0-31562";"I should make for the coast to the west and see if there are Ayleid ruins there where the fragments might be found."
"103224356-0-31563";"If I could find the other pieces, the completed tablet might be worth something to the right person. I should look around for more."
"103224356-0-31564";"I should see if Eminaire has any interest in the fragments I recovered."
"103224356-0-31565";"With the horrors of Nilata behind us, it's time to return Najan."
"103224356-0-31566";"With the horrors of Nilata behind us, it's time to return Najan."
"103224356-0-31567";"I should find someone who might be interested in reassembling and deciphering this tablet. Scholars and researchers frequent the Ayleid ruins around Grahtwood. I should start with those."
"103224356-0-31568";"Llotha and I figured out the password and unlocked the lockbox. I should speak to her about what she found inside."
"103224356-0-31569";"<<1>> needs a book on Wood Elf folklore. <<2>> is looking for something that could fit. I should wait to see what he finds."

"103224356-0-31594";"I found <<1>> at the top of a tower. I should talk to her and find out what she's looking for."
"103224356-0-31595";"I found the <<1>>. I need to meet <<2>> at the <<3>>."

"103224356-0-31628";"Something's wrong with the mage. I should follow <<1>> into <<2>> to find out what's wrong with him."
"103224356-0-31629";"We arrived at <<1>> to find <<2>> turned into iron. I should ask <<3>> for more details."

"103224356-0-31631";"<<1>>'s experiments with the <<2>> separated his emotions from his personality.  I can use the <<2>> to enter <<3>>'s ""dreamstate"" and recover <<1>>'s emotions."
"103224356-0-31632";"I used the <<1>> to enter <<2>>'s ""dreamstate.""  To recover <<3>>'s emotions, I must make each emotion feel its opposite to stabilize it."
"103224356-0-31633";"I successfully recovered <<1>>'s emotions. I should talk to him in <<2>> to see how, or if, he feels."

"103224356-0-31636";"The amulet is clearly magical, but I can't discern its purpose. I should look around the area for clues regarding this person's demise."

"103224356-0-36879";"Lyris said the Coldharbour Sentinels are allowing Molag Bal to watch over the Wailing Prison directly. If we are to escape Coldharbour, we will need to blind him by destroying one of the Sentinels."
"103224356-0-36881";"The spell is complete! I should make my way to the portal."
"103224356-0-36882";"The Prophet has begun summoning something to lift us to the portal above. I should wait for him to complete the spell."
"103224356-0-36883";"The Undercroft reeks of death. We should carefully make our way through and enter the Prophet's cell."
"103224356-0-36884";"We've found the Prophet, but he's within some kind of magical prison. I should see if Lyris knows how to get him out."
"103224356-0-36885";"The Prophet said we'll need a Skyshard in order to return to Tamriel and attune my corporeal form to Nirn. I should collect the Skyshard."
"103224356-0-36886";"We made it to the Anchor Mooring. I should talk to the Prophet."
"103224356-0-36887";"Lyris knows someone named Cadwell who might know a different way into the Prophet's cell. We should find him and see what he knows."
"103224356-0-36888";"The Prophet and I must fight our way past the guardian and through to the Mooring's base if we're to escape."
"103224356-0-36889";"We've made our way to the Dark Anchor. The Prophet and I will need to reach the base of the Anchor Mooring."
"103224356-0-36890";"The Prophet knows of a Daedric Anchor we can use to return to Tamriel. We should leave this place."
"103224356-0-36891";"The Prophet is free, but Lyris is now trapped in the cell. I should talk to the Prophet and find out what's next."
"103224356-0-36892";"We've entered the cell. The Prophet should be in here somewhere."
"103224356-0-36893";"The way to Tamriel is open! I must enter the rift to escape!"
"103224356-0-36894";"I've emerged from the rift in an unfamiliar place. The Prophet is nearby, but his form is indistinct and translucent. I should speak with him."
"103224356-0-36895";"Lyris must switch places with the Prophet in order to free him. Her efforts will catch the attention of more guards, no doubt."
"103224356-0-36896";"The pinions on either side of the ritual circle seem to be activated. I should see if I can manipulate them to complete the ritual."
"103224356-0-36897";"Lyris has to trade places with the Prophet in order to free him. I should wait for her to complete the exchange."
"103224356-0-36911";"A Worm Cult assassin jumped me at Betar-Nes's house."
"103224356-0-36912";"I must mount the twin Hagraven heads to draw out the matriarch."
"103224356-0-36944";"I need to go to the old Nord barrow and check on the treasure hunter named Narsis Dren. I should look for him in the barrow at the top of the hill."
"103224356-0-36945";"Narsis Dren believes we can find a way to return the draugr to their rest in the barrow's main burial chamber. He wants me to lead the way as we search for it."
"103224356-0-36946";"Inside the antechamber, we found a large, impressive door that must lead to the main burial chamber. Maybe Narsis Dren has an idea about how we can open it. I should talk to him."
"103224356-0-36947";"We have the broken puzzle pieces. Now we need to solve the puzzle lock to open the doors to the main burial chamber. Perhaps Narsis Dren has an idea about how we should proceed."
"103224356-0-36948";"Narsis Dren thinks that we need to solve a puzzle lock to open the door to the main burial chamber. But three of the stone panels are broken. We need to find the missing pieces of the panels before we can attempt to solve the puzzle."
"103224356-0-36949";"I should follow Narsis Dren through the door and speak to him on the other side."
"103224356-0-36950";"Now that we entered the ancient tomb, we should see if we can find a way to end the draugr dilemma."
"103224356-0-36951";"Narsis Dren led me to the treasure vault, which was likely his goal all along. I should speak to him."
"103224356-0-36952";"So all of this was Narsis Dren's fault. Still, we were able to defeat the Dragon priest and the draugr should start to settle down now. I should return to Mazgroth's clan and make sure everything is all right."
"103224356-0-36953";"I should return to the village and let Mazgroth know what Narsis Dren did. He may have caused the draugr problem, but at least he helped me fix it in the end."
"103224356-0-36954";"I convinced Narsis to offer the Orcs some gold for the trouble he caused them. I should let Mazgorth know that the draugr won't be bothering them any longer."
"103224356-0-36955";"I should talk to Narsis Dren and convince him to tell the Orcs the truth about Exile's Barrow."
"103224356-0-36956";"I should tell Mazgroth the truth about what occurred in the Exile's Barrow."
"103224356-0-36971";"I should talk to Rigurt and give him the things he needs to prepare a romantic evening for Ambassador Lazdutha."
"103224356-0-36972";"Rigurt wants me to collect food that Orcs consider seductive so that he can prepare a romantic meal for Ambassador Lazdutha. He has given me Nordic equivalents to trade for Orc cheese and Orc ale. He also wants Orc poetry and perfume—just in case."

"103224356-0-36976";"According to <<1>>, her daughter is somewhere in <<2>>. I should search for <<3>>."
"103224356-0-36977";"<<1>> and I found our way into Morkuldin. I should explore the lost home of the Morkul clan."
"103224356-0-36978";"I discovered a great forge, and what seems to be the Hand of Morkul. Unfortunately, it is trapped within the forge itself. I should speak with <<1>> and see if she has any ideas on how to release it."
"103224356-0-36979";"<<1>> asked me to rekindle Morkuldin's great forge. She thinks that doing so will release the Hand of Morkul. I should activate the blast furnace and the bellows."
"103224356-0-36980";"I rekindled Morkuldin's great forge. I should return to <<1>>."
"103224356-0-36981";"I convinced <<1>> to return the Hand of Morkul to her clan. I should meet her at Morkul Stronghold."
"103224356-0-36983";"I should meet <<1>> in Morkul Stronghold. She said she would wait for my arrival to address her clan about the Hand of Morkul's fate."

"103224356-0-36995";"I collected the items Rigurt needs to prepare a romantic dinner for Ambassador Lazdutha, the Orc he wants to woo. I should return to Morkul Clanhold and give him the items."
"103224356-0-37002";"Meram offered to buy the amulet from me in the hope that she can sell it for a profit to someone interested in the legend of Thukhozod. But Khoruzoth's mother would likely want it to remember her son by. I need to decide what to do with the amulet."
"103224356-0-37005";"Stibbons said I should talk to Lady Laurent. He thinks she needs help completing this particular expedition. She should be coming down the trail any moment now. I should head up there and meet her."
"103224356-0-37006";"I need to climb the mountain named Sorrow and locate Torug's shrine. Lady Laurent also asked me to place trail markers for the rest of the expedition to follow."
"103224356-0-37008";"Now that Kharsthun translated the ancient Orcish inscriptions I found, I should talk to Lady Laurent and see what she thinks."
"103224356-0-37009";"Lady Laurent wants me to ascend to Sorrow's peak and retrieve the enchanted bracer known as the Armlet of Torug."
"103224356-0-37010";"I recovered the Armlet of Torug, but I'm starting to feel a little light-headed. I should return to the relative safety of the shrine as quickly as I can."
"103224356-0-37011";"I recovered the Armlet of Torug from Sorrow's summit. In my absence, Lady Laurent and Kharsthun's disagreement seems to have grown. Now I need to decide who to give this ancient treasure to. I should talk to both of them before I make my decision."
"103224356-0-37012";"It appears that the Armlet of Torug turned Stibbons into a block of ice. I should talk to Lady Laurent about this."
"103224356-0-37013";"It appears that the Armlet of Torug turned Stibbons into a block of ice. I should talk to Lady Laurent about this."
"103224356-0-37014";"I should look for a researcher who's interested in ancient Nord curiosities and see if they want the relics I found."
"103224356-0-37015";"I should talk to Berrice and find out what she plans to do with the Nord relics I gave to her."
"103224356-0-37016";"Berrice said I should look her up at the museum in Orsinium. If the relics I provided her with turn out to have any historical value, she promised me a reward."
"103224356-0-37019";"I agreed to help Meram and Bardun complete their contract. I should check inside the ruins for the missing Orc, Khoruzoth."
"103224356-0-37023";"I should search the wrecked ships for the ambassador, Lady Sovelle, or any other survivors. I can also speak to survivors in the camp to see if they have any useful information about what happened out there."
"103224356-0-37027";"I found Lady Sovelle's bodyguard, Skordo the Knife. Now I need to locate the ambassador."
"103224356-0-37028";"While searching for any sign of Lady Sovelle, Skordo and I ran into Holbert and Lord Ethian. I should talk to Ethian and find out if he has any news."
"103224356-0-37029";"Lord Ethian ran off. He thinks his wife might be at the nearby signal tower. I should follow after him and make sure he doesn't get into any trouble."
"103224356-0-37031";"I caught up to Lord Ethian on top of the signal tower. I should talk to him."
"103224356-0-37032";"Lord Ethian admitted that his father wanted to sabotage the ambassador's mission. But he also claims that there was no plan for anyone to get hurt and that he doesn't know where Sovelle is. We should return to Skordo and Holbert."
"103224356-0-37033";"Holbert the first mate explained that Skordo spotted an old smuggler's cave and went to investigate. He thinks that Captain Henrisa and the ambassador may be there. I should go and meet him."
"103224356-0-37035";"I rescued Lady Sovelle and she left the smuggler's cave to check on her wounded husband. I should catch up with her and see if there's anything else I can do."

"103224356-0-37043";"I found First Mate Holbert in one of the wrecked ships. Now I need to look for the ambassador and her bodyguard."
"103224356-0-37044";"I successfully calibrated the Orb of Illumination and unlocked the chest. I should talk to Neramo to see what he found inside."
"103224356-0-37045";"Neramo can now prevent the Dwarven constructs from attacking the quarry. I should go back to the surface and let the Orcs know that it's safe to return to work."
"103224356-0-37050";"I found <<1>> in <<2>>, but she seems wounded. I should speak with her."
"103224356-0-37051";"<<1>> seeks Morkuldin, the ancient home of her clan, which holds a relic known as the Hand of Morkul. I should help her search for the hidden entrance. She believes the nearby statues are clues to finding Morkuldin."
"103224356-0-37056";"We're inside Frostbreak Fortress. Alinon wants us to look around and see if we notice any unusual plants or flowers. He thinks there must be something to lead us to the source of the briarhearts."

"103224356-0-37085";"Fanatics have taken control of the Trinimac temple in Orsinium and are holding hostages. Forge-Mother Alga thinks it's a trap for King Kurog. She asked me to go to the temple in his place and rescue the hostages."
"103224356-0-37088";"I see that King Kurog's soldiers have taken up a position outside the temple. I should talk to the captain and see what the situation is."
"103224356-0-37089";"The fanatics have barred the temple's main entrance from the inside. I need to find another way to get inside. The captain suggested their might be a back entrance. I should search around for that."
"103224356-0-37094";"<<1>> no longer poses a threat to Rkindaleft. With his plans in ruins, he asked me to end his suffering. I must decide whether to close the final pressure valve and kill him, or return to <<2>> and leave him to his fate."

"103224356-0-37264";"A pair of burial urns should unlock the tomb doors. It seems I must find and drink from a pair of memorial pools to release the urns. I should search for the pools in the catacombs near the tomb."
"103224356-0-37265";"I should place both burial urns to unlock the tomb doors."
"103224356-0-37268";"I found Eveli at Fharun Stronghold. I should talk to her and see if she's learned anything that can aid us in this situation."
"103224356-0-37269";"Eveli discovered that there's a large prison of some sort somewhere within Fharun Stronghold. I need to look around and see if I can determine the location of the prison without raising the alarm."
"103224356-0-37270";"I discovered that the prison is hidden beneath Fharun Stronghold. I should meet Eveli behind the great hall and exchange information before we attempt to get inside."
"103224356-0-37271";"Eveli secured the rope and dropped it into the well. I should climb down and see if I can locate the clan chief that the cult has taken prisoner."

"103224356-0-37276";"I agreed to aid Razasha and rescue Shaldagan and the other Orcs that were taken captive by the Vosh Rakh. I should enter the nearby ruins and look for the kidnapped travelers."
"103224356-0-37277";"I freed Thorkh, one of the unwilling recruits brought to Paragon's Remembrance. According to Glothun's list I still need to find Shaldagan, Morushna, Batasha, and the two mages, Unsulag and Garhar."
"103224356-0-37278";"I set all of the captured Orcs free. Now I need to safely lead them out of the ruins of Paragon's Remembrance."
"103224356-0-37279";"I led the rescued Orcs, including Shaldagan, out of the ruins of Paragon's Remembrance. Now I should exit the ruins and talk to Razasha to make sure everyone is all right."
"103224356-0-37286";"I need to search the underground prison and find the Orc chief taken captive by the Vosh Rakh."
"103224356-0-37287";"Chief Bazrag is the prisoner? I should talk to him and find out what's going on here."
"103224356-0-37294";"I need to escort Chief Bazrag safely out of the prison and back to High Priestess Solgra. Then maybe we can figure out what's really going on here."
"103224356-0-37300";"There's a captive in a cage near Glothun the Recruiter. I should set him free."
"103224356-0-37309";"I should talk to Kireth and find out more about the construct that Raynor tinkered with."
"103224356-0-37310";"The nearby wreckage appears to be the result of Raynor's latest experiment—a reactivated Dwarven sphere. If I use the lightning prod that Kireth gave me, I might be able to track the sphere by its energy discharges."
"103224356-0-37311";"The lightning prod revealed after-images of the sphere and showed me which direction it headed in. I should follow the trail and see if it leads me to Raynor."
"103224356-0-37312";"The sphere's energy trail led me to Raynor Vanos. I should talk to him and find out what happened after Kireth was knocked unconscious."
"103224356-0-37313";"I finally caught up to the runaway Dwarven sphere. Raynor said I should use the lightning prod to siphon off some of the sphere's excess energy."
"103224356-0-37314";"Just as I drove off the runaway sphere, Kireth and Raynor arrived. I think Kireth wants to talk to me. I should speak with her."
"103224356-0-37318";"The lightning prod revealed another after-image. If I follow it, I should be able to find the runaway Dwarven sphere."
"103224356-0-37319";"I finally caught up with the runaway Dwarven sphere at a camp of Reachmen raiders. I need to deal with the raiders and use the lightning prod on the sphere."
"103224356-0-37322";"After defeating the Reachmen, the Dwarven sphere took off again. I should follow it."
"103224356-0-37323";"Now that the Dwarven sphere has stopped rolling around, I should talk to Kireth and Raynor. Kireth wants to destroy it, but Raynor wants to repair it. I should see what they both have to say before we decide what to do with the construct."
"103224356-0-37324";"I agreed with Raynor and let him fix the Dwarven sphere. It looks like he fixed it all right, but then it rolled off into the wilderness and Raynor went after it. I should talk to Kireth and see what she wants to do now."
"103224356-0-37325";"I agreed with Kireth that the Dwarven sphere needed to be destroyed. I should talk to her to make sure the task was accomplished."
"103224356-0-37326";"I escorted Chief Bazrag out of the Fharun prison. I should talk to him and see if I can figure out what's really going on here."

"103224356-0-37352";"I need to talk to Eveli and explain what happened to Talviah. She also needs to know what I learned from Forge-Mother Alga."
"103224356-0-37353";"I unlocked the tomb doors. I should enter with <<1>> and <<2>>."
"103224356-0-37355";"<<1>> asked me to find evidence of this Daedric connection. She suggested searching <<2>>'s tent, as well as the giant camp where <<3>> was struck. I should also ask <<4>> if he noticed anything suspicious the night before the chief was wounded."
"103224356-0-37358";"I found a copy of <<1>> in <<2>>'s tent, as well as <<3>> in the giant camp where <<4>> was wounded. <<5>> and <<6>> heard her moving around the night before the chief was wounded. I should see what <<2>> has to say about this."
"103224356-0-37359";"<<1>> has demanded <<2>> pay the blood price for causing <<3>>'s death and named me her champion in the matter. I should speak with <<2>> about <<1>>'s demands."

"103224356-0-37369";"It seems they were both right. This is the tomb of <<1>> and <<2>>—supposedly, two mortal enemies. I should look for an explanation of why this is possible."
"103224356-0-37370";"I was drawn into another memory of past events, during the fall of Old Orsinium. I walk in the boots of <<1>>, a Knight of the Dragon who learned <<2>> planned to interfere with the duel of <<3>> and <<4>>. I should warn <<5>>, quickly!"
"103224356-0-37371";"I was drawn into another memory of past events, during the fall of Old Orsinium. I walk in the boots of <<1>>, a Knight of the Dragon who arrived to late to stop <<2>>'s betrayal. <<3>> and <<4>> are dead. <<5>> is wounded—I should speak with him."

"103224356-0-37398";"I should tell the Drake of Blades about what I discovered in the chapel."
"103224356-0-37399";"The map that the Drake of Blades found indicates that the Worm Cult's skeletal minions are digging beneath the crematorium. I should collect concentrated kindlepitch from Xivkyn Soulbranders. I may be able to cause a cave in with the right amount."
"103224356-0-37400";"I must use the concentrated kindlepitch to destroy the Worm Cult's secret dig site. This should cripple their attempt to find the Dragonfire Cathedral."
"103224356-0-37401";"I've destroyed the site where Molag Bal's skeletons were searching for something called the ""Dragonfire Cathedral."" Their digging operation is crippled. I should return to the alliance base and speak with the Drake of Blades about our next move."

"103224356-0-37405";"I should search for the stolen goods. The journal said they were located just north of <<1>>, at the intersection of ""aqueduct legs, narrow tree, gray serpent."""

"103224356-0-37413";"I should decide what to do with this hideous mug. I could speak with <<1>> about what I dug up. However, <<2>>'s journal mentioned a buyer. If I wanted, I could sell the mug to <<3>>."
"103224356-0-37416";"A messenger brought me a letter. He said he received it from a Wood Elf. I should open my Inventory and read the letter."
"103224356-0-37417";"Eveli's message is in some sort of code. She told the messenger that the letter itself wasn't important, that what really matters is the beginning of every thought. I wonder if that's a clue to help me decipher the message?"
"103224356-0-37418";"The innkeeper's daughter directed me to a hidden passage in the lower storage area of the Greedy Gut. She said it would lead to a secret room where Eveli and Solgra are waiting for me. I should go and meet them there."
"103224356-0-37419";"<<1>> agreed to give me a cut of her loot from the sale of the hideous mug. I should meet her in the Greedy Gut to settle up."

"103224356-0-37425";"High-Priestess Solgra explained her position. The Vosh Rakh are the real threat and they have to be contained. I should talk to Eveli and see if I can make her understand what's at stake here."
"103224356-0-37426";"I need to meet up with Eveli and the scouts at the ruins of Paragon's Remembrance."
"103224356-0-37429";"I returned the mug to <<1>>. I should speak with him about a reward."
"103224356-0-37430";"I rendezvoused with Eveli and the scouts, Talviah and Flies-in-Wind. I should talk to Eveli and find out what they've learned about the area around Paragon's Remembrance."
"103224356-0-37431";"I need to find a way to disguise ourselves as a Vosh Rakh cultist so that Eveli, the scouts, and I can gain entry to the ruins. Eveli suggested I follow the group that went west toward the echatere mating grounds."
"103224356-0-37435";"With the amulet I found, I should be able to enter the ruins of Paragon's Remembrance undetected."
"103224356-0-37436";"<<1>> asked me to bring her <<mz:2>>, some <<z:3>>, and <<z:4>>."

"103224356-0-37443";"The Worm Cult has been using the exhumed skeletons to excavate something called the Dragonfire Cathedral. I should meet up with the Drake of Blades in the Undertaker's Office to plan our next move."
"103224356-0-37447";"I entered the Chambers of Loyalty. I need to find out what the high-ranking Vosh Rakh are meeting about. Then I should rendezvous with Talviah and compare notes."
"103224356-0-37450";"I need to complete the trials in order to learn what the Vosh Rakh are planning for Orsinium. Apparently, I can read the scrolls and select one of Trinimac's blessings to aid me."
"103224356-0-37451";"<<1>> asked me to bring her <<z:2>>, some <<z:3>>, and an <<z:4>>."
"103224356-0-37452";"I have the ingredients <<1>> requested. I should bring them to her."

"103224356-0-37483";"The Vosh Rakh council seems to know who I am. They want me to kill Talviah to prove my devotion to Trinimac. If I do that, they'll tell me the information I came here to uncover. So, should I kill my ally or attack the Vosh Rakh?"
"103224356-0-37484";"I learned the Vosh Rakh's plan to eliminate the chiefs at the moot and blame High Priestess Solgra from Forge-Mother Alga. I should rendezvous with Eveli and Flies-in-Wind to let them know."
"103224356-0-37485";"I need to leave the Chambers of Loyalty and find Eveli and Flies-In-Wind. Chief Bazrag and Eveli are in danger, and the Vosh Rakh plan to kill the clan chiefs at the moot."

"103224356-0-37488";"King Kurog has discovered that Eveli Sharp-Arrow is trying to get Chief Bazrag to High-Priestess Solgra safely. I should try to find Eveli and warn her that the king is looking for her."

"103224356-0-37514";"I dealt with some Vosh Rakh fanatics disguised as Orsimer soldiers and recovered the key to the Greedy Gut inn. Now I should enter the inn and find Chief Bazrag and Eveli."
"103224356-0-37515";"I freed as many of the cult's captives as I could. I should eliminate the leader of the cultists here in Paragon's Remembrance, Azhnura the Proselytizer. That should curtail the Vosh Rakh's recruitment efforts in Wrothgar."
"103224356-0-37516";"I found Chief Bazrag and Eveli inside the inn. I should talk to the chief and compare notes."
"103224356-0-37517";"I must travel to the Imperial Arena, enter the Daedra's bloody martial contest, and defeat all comers."
"103224356-0-37518";"After I slaughtered the Daedra in the Imperial Arena, a threadbare figure appeared outside the arena and called to me.\n\nThis may be The Rat. I should follow him."
"103224356-0-37519";"I've discovered The Rat's hideout, a small room beneath the Imperial Arena. I should see what he has to say about Molag Bal's plans for Imperial City."
"103224356-0-37520";"The Rat told me that Molag Bal somehow plans to ""erase"" the Dragonfires, which prevent Daedric invasions so long as an emperor descended from Saint Alessia holds the throne. He suggested I bring this news to the Drake of Blades in the sewers."
"103224356-0-37521";"I told the Drake of Blades about The Rat's claims that Molag Bal has a way to extinguish the Dragonfires forever, even if a new emperor is crowned. We should plan our next move."
"103224356-0-37522";"King Kurog didn't want to talk in front of the clan chiefs. He asked me to meet him in the dining hall on the lower level of the keep to continue our conversation."
"103224356-0-37523";"I've slaughtered all Daedra in the Imperial Arena. Perhaps this will catch The Rat's attention. I should wait to be contacted."
"103224356-0-37524";"Forge-Mother Alga attacked me. I'm not completely certain what happened after that, but I seem to be somewhere safe with Chief Bazrag. I should talk to him."
"103224356-0-37525";"I led the rescued Orcs out of Paragon's Remembrance. I should talk to Razasha and make sure everyone's all right."
"103224356-0-37526";"I led the rescued Orcs, including Shaldagan, out of the ruins of Paragon's Remembrance. Now I should exit the ruins and talk to Razasha to make sure everyone is all right."
"103224356-0-37527";"I recovered the key to the Greedy Gut inn. Now I should enter the inn and find Chief Bazrag and Eveli."
"103224356-0-37547";"I agreed to extract the blood price from <<1>> through honorable combat. I should meet her by the river."
"103224356-0-37548";"<<1>> claims she had nothing to do with <<2>>'s death. I should speak with <<3>> and see what she thinks of <<3>>'s explanations."
"103224356-0-37549";"<<1>> refused to pay the blood price to <<2>>, but chose exile to prevent further animosity in Shatul. I should speak with <<2>> to make sure the grudge is settled."
"103224356-0-37556";"I managed to get inside the inn, but everyone's gone except the messenger who gave me Eveli's note. I should talk to him and find out what happened."
"103224356-0-37557";"Owayine claimed that King Kurog ordered the attack on the inn. I should go to the keep and find out what happened to Chief Bazrag and Eveli Sharp-Arrow."

"103224356-0-38665";"I should meet <<1>> at Hew's Mane, a tavern in Abah's Landing."
"103224356-0-38666";"<<1>> suspects <<2>> escaped from the Iron Wheel. She learned of someone called the ""Desert Falcon"" who has been asking about <<2>>. She asked me to find and approach the Desert Falcon in the Greenshade city of Marbruk."

"103224356-0-38672";"I located the manor belonging to <<1>>, the High Elf seen with <<2>>. I should speak with her and see what I can learn of his whereabouts."
"103224356-0-38673";"<<1>> said her husband is an Imperial man named Vantus, not <<2>>. When I asked to speak with him, she insisted I leave. I should find a way into her manor."
"103224356-0-38675";"<<1>> and Vantus are the same person. I should decide what to do with him. <<2>> left his fate to my discretion."
"103224356-0-38676";"<<1>> is dead. I should return to Abah's Landing and inform <<2>> of his fate."

"103224356-0-38682";"I'm in <<1>> in Abah's Landing. I should speak with my date about getting <<2>> inside the palace."

"103224356-0-38726";"There's no sign of <<1>>. I can only assume the worst. If I can track him down, perhaps I can free him from the Iron Wheel. Alternatively, I could leave him to his fate. If that's the case, I can tell <<2>> we should leave without him."
"103224356-0-38727";"Perhaps someone can point me in the direction of <<1>>. I should ask any possible witnesses of his capture."
"103224356-0-38729";"The matter with <<1>> is resolved. I should talk to <<2>> at Prince's Gate when I'm ready to depart Abah's Landing."
"103224356-0-38730";"When I'm ready, I should speak with <<1>> and let her know I'm ready to travel to <<c:2>>."
"103224356-0-38731";"The Iron Wheel has set up camp outside <<c:1>>. I should sneak past the camp in order to reach the entrance."

"103224356-0-38740";"We awoke an ancient tomb guardian! We must defeat it!"
"103224356-0-38741";"We should search the al-Danobia treasure vaults for <<1>>'s dowry, or clues to its absence."
"103224356-0-38742";"<<1>>'s dowry is gone, and <<2>>—the former guildmaster—may have had something to do with it. I should return to Hew's Bane as soon as I can. From there, I will meet <<3>> at <<2>>'s desert retreat."

"103224356-0-38763";"The matter with <<1>> seems resolved, but I should speak with <<2>> in Abah's Landing to be certain."
"103224356-0-38764";"<<1>> is unharmed. I should return to Abah's Landing and inform <<2>> of his fate."
"103224356-0-38765";"The matter with <<1>> seems resolved, but I should speak with <<2>> in Abah's Landing to be certain."
"103224356-0-38766";"I decided to kill <<1>>. I will make it quick."
"103224356-0-38767";"It seems the Iron Wheel dragged <<1>> to a remote area where they like to ""soften up"" their captives. If I plan to rescue him, I should head there as soon as I can."
"103224356-0-38782";"Now that we've bypassed Tu'whacca's Pillars, we should venture deeper into <<c:1>>."

"103224356-0-38812";"The vampire lord Zalar-do lurks somewhere in Hrota Cave with two people from Anvil that she captured. I agreed to help Mel Adrys track down the vampire and rescue her captives—provided they're still alive."

"103224356-0-38825";"I should speak with <<1>> and see what she turned up. I can find her at the Abah's Landing harbor."
"103224356-0-38826";"<<1>> suspects a dockyard boss may be a candidate for <<2>>'s blackmail. To confirm this, I could spy on a meeting he called with ""the Imperial client,"" or search the Imperial's private room at the Serpent and Senche."
"103224356-0-38827";"I should speak with <<1>> and see what she plans to do."

"103224356-0-38907";"<<1>> wants me to search the mansion's courtyard and kitchen area for a few of the keepsakes from his time living here with Anais. As I search, I should take care to remain hidden so as not to attract attention."
"103224356-0-38908";"I think we overstayed our welcome. <<1>> and I should leave Anais's family mansion immediately."
"103224356-0-38909";"<<1>> approached us while we were on the balcony. She said some terrible things to <<2>>. I should confront her about this."

"103224356-0-38920";"I should talk to <<1>> in <<Ac:2>>."
"103224356-0-38922";"I should meet <<1>> at her rooftop retreat."
"103224356-0-38924";"I should speak with <<1>> in the <<2>>."
"103224356-0-38925";"I should bring the <<c:1>> with me. It's in <<Ac:2>>."
"103224356-0-38927";"I need to use this <<1>> to absorb the energy of the spirits released by the necromancers in <<2>>."
"103224356-0-38928";"<<1>> has absorbed a fair amount of energy. I can use it now to recharge the seal protecting <<2>>."
"103224356-0-38929";"I restored the seal protecting <<1>> with the energy from <<2>>. I should return the amulet to the priest and let her know what happened."
"103224356-0-38932";"<<1>> learned <<2>> was spotted in town. He suspects a local named Bellulor may know more, but has been unable to track him down. I should search for Bellulor in the Shornhelm Outlaws Refuge, in Rivenspire."

"103224356-0-38935";"Someone in the market slipped a folded letter into Velsa's things. She thinks it may be related to her family or that it could be a trap. I should read the letter before I investigate further."
"103224356-0-38936";"Velsa doesn't remember anything suspicious except for the half-naked Nord who bumped into her. She thinks I can find him in the merchant camp outside the city. I should ask him if he knows anything about the letter."
"103224356-0-38937";"The half-naked Nord said that he met the Khajiit woman who paid him to deliver the letter to Velsa in Riften. I should travel to the Rift and see if I can find this mysterious Khajiit."

"103224356-0-38939";"I entered the servants' quarters. Now I should talk to Narahni and ask her if she sent the letter to Velsa."
"103224356-0-38940";"Narahni did send the letter to Velsa. I convinced her to come to Abah's Landing to see Velsa in person. I should meet her there."
"103224356-0-38941";"Now that Narahni is ready, I should lead her through the warehouse and secret passage to Velsa's secluded garden so the old friends can be reunited."
"103224356-0-38942";"Velsa and Narahni seem to have worked out their past differences. I should speak to Velsa and see if she needs anything else from me."
"103224356-0-38943";"Velsa and Narahni have found each other again, and in spite of the years they lost, they both appear to be happy. I should talk to Velsa and see if she needs anything else from me."
"103224356-0-38946";"Apparently, a group of Red Sails pirates is about to be initiated into the Order of the Hour. If I can stop the initiation, I can keep the Order from growing and gaining more recruits."
"103224356-0-38948";"I should tell Astara what transpired at the Enclave of the Hourglass."
"103224356-0-38949";"I disrupted the initiation. Now I should look around and try to find the Black Dragon or any information that will give the Brotherhood an advantage against the Order's First Sword."
"103224356-0-38950";"I entered the Enclave of the Hourglass and walked in on a meeting between one of the Red Sails captains and an officer of the Order of the Hour. I should put an end to their negotiations."

"103224356-0-38979";"I need to reach the room where Dathus Ildrim is hiding and open a secret passage. This will allow Naryu to covertly enter the castle, dispatch her target, and leave without being spotted."
"103224356-0-38980";"Dathus is fast asleep. I need to open the secret passage so Naryu can enter his room and dispatch him."
"103224356-0-38981";"Naryu has arrived to dispatch Dathus Ildrim. I should stand back and let her complete her contract without interference."
"103224356-0-38982";"Naryu allowed Dathus to call for the Castle Kvatch sentinels before she killed him. To fulfill my part of the bargain, I need to leave by the main entrance and make sure someone spots me so I can take credit for assassinating Dathus."
"103224356-0-38983";"I made sure I was seen leaving Castle Kvatch so that I'm sure to be blamed for the assassination of the Dark Elf noble. I should meet Naryu at the inn and wrap up our business arrangement."
"103224356-0-38984";"Naryu confirmed that no one spotted her leaving the castle. Her secret is safe, thanks to my help. I should find out what she plans to do next."
"103224356-0-38989";"I convinced Walks-Softly to leave Anais with the pirates to teach her a lesson. I should go back to the Thieves Den and meet up with Walks-Softly so that we can put this despicable business behind us."

"103224356-0-39004";"I should talk to Narahni before taking her to see Velsa."
"103224356-0-39011";"I turned over the goods to Fa'ren-dar. He'll be waiting with my share at <<Ac:1>>."
"103224356-0-39015";"I need to find valuables being stashed in the Hideaway, but it'd be best if I don't attract any undue attention and let the owners know the guild is on to them."
"103224356-0-39018";"I have the loot. Now I need to get the haul to Fa'ren-dar."
"103224356-0-39021";"The valuables are secured in the hideout beyond this entry. They are sure to be guarded. I need to maintain a low profile."

"103224356-0-39086";"I should watch Walks-Softly as he interacts with Anais Velmont so I can see what he's planning to do."
"103224356-0-39087";"It appears that Walks-Softly has kidnapped Anais and asked for a ransom to be paid. I'm not sure how this teaches her the lesson that Walks-Softly keeps talking about. I should speak to him and find out what he's actually thinking."
"103224356-0-39090";"Walks-Softly wants to keep Anais's family from looking for her while he teaches her a lesson. He asked me to plant these letters he forged in the Velmont Mansion to explain her absence."
"103224356-0-39091";"Walks-Softly requested that I meet him back in the Thieves Den after I delivered the forged letters to the Velmont Mansion."

"103224356-0-39335";"I should find her in an Outlaws Refuge."
"103224356-0-39338";"I think the caravan master helped Hildegard leave Anvil, but I can't get a straight answer out of her. Maybe Kor can convince her to help us. I should stand back and let him give it a try."

"103224356-0-39370";"Hildegard was tricked by Chanter Nemus and then set upon by the Silver Dawn. It was all some sort of elaborate trap, but we don't know what motivated the chanter. I need to either offer Hilde words of encouragement or scold her to teach her a lesson."
"103224356-0-39371";"I found a way into the Cathedral of Akatosh. Now I need to deal with Primate Artorius and make him pay for his transgressions against the Dark Brotherhood."

"103224356-0-41626";"Titus Valerius offered to help me stop the Anka-Ra if I free him from his binds."
"103224356-0-41627";"I retrieved the amulet Erold sent me after, and now a mysterious celestial figure resembling a thief has appeared. I should hear what she has to say."
"103224356-0-41628";"Hermaeus Mora revealed secret information concerning the origins of the Anka-Ra, but he refuses to reveal more unless I bring him an offering. I should ask Ibrula what he means."
"103224356-0-41629";"I defeated Shada. I should return to Sali'ma and tell him of my success."
"103224356-0-41630";"I should enter Shada's Tear and find the leader of the researchers, Sali'ma."
"103224356-0-41631";"The Thief suddenly appeared before me after Tarish-Zi was vanquished. I should speak with her."
"103224356-0-41632";"I should speak with Erold at the Star-Gazer observatory."
"103224356-0-41633";"I defeated Abelazar of the Scaled Court. I should return to the entrance of Rahni'Za to let Fada at-Glina know that things have been resolved."
"103224356-0-41634";"I need to complete three trials—Arena, Air, and Martial Knowledge—before I can access the final trial and find the betrayer."
"103224356-0-41635";"The three trials are complete. Now I need to find my way into the final trial through the library and defeat Abelazar the betrayer."
"103224356-0-41636";"I found the seals to activate the beams and open the temple door. Now I should go to the center of the ruin and enter the temple."
"103224356-0-41637";"The first trial of Rahni'Za involves gaining entrance to the school. If the flames of the braziers are not lit, I'll need to defeat gargoyles in order to light the flames and gain entrance to the school."
"103224356-0-41638";"On entering Rahni'Za, I encountered the spirit of a former initiate. I should speak to him and see if he has any other information about the trials."
"103224356-0-41639";"Abelazar the betrayer has been defeated. I should speak to Master Timen's spirit outside of the Trial of the True Path before I leave Rahni'Za."

"103224356-0-41641";"Sali'ma believes that the waters are being corrupted by nereids in the crypt and city wings of Shada's Tear. I should explore those wings and find a way to stop the corruption."
"103224356-0-41642";"Ibrula believes that the Daedric Prince of Knowledge, Hermaeus Mora, possesses secret knowledge about how to defeat the Celestials. I should approach his statue and speak to him."
"103224356-0-41643";"When I underwent the Star-Gazers' ritual, I was transported to an otherworldly realm! A strange woman has appeared before me. Perhaps she can tell me what's going on."
"103224356-0-41644";"The woman claimed to be the constellation of the Thief. She asked me to aid her and the Star-Gazers in resisting the Serpent, a powerful being known as a Celestial. Though I must return to Tamriel, I shouldn't reveal this encounter to others."
"103224356-0-41645";"The Trial of Air has something to do with a hidden path across the tops of the school buildings. Zabeth mentioned that it was only visible when special sands are thrown on it. Maybe some of the thralls are carrying sand that I can use."
"103224356-0-41647";"The temple door is sealed. I should look for a way to activate the beams that open the temple door."
"103224356-0-41655";"I entered the temple. Ibrula wishes to speak to me. I should hear what she has to say."
"103224356-0-41656";"I'm inside the temple. Now I should find Hermaeus Mora's shrine. Ibrula says it's located in the deepest part of the temple."
"103224356-0-41657";"I freed Nahlia. Ralai has joined us. I should talk to her."
"103224356-0-41658";"I need to find the mad researchers so I can save Nahlia."
"103224356-0-41660";"I should read the scroll on the altar and use the prayer wheel to unlock the door deeper into the city wing."
"103224356-0-41661";"I unlocked the door. I should follow Ralai deeper into the city wing to find Nahlia."
"103224356-0-41662";"I should find Nahlia and free her."
"103224356-0-41663";"I freed Nahlia. I should talk to her and see what she learned about the mad researchers."
"103224356-0-41664";"I defeated Yamanu-ko. I should tell Minerva what happened."

"103224356-0-41668";"I found Minerva Lauzon. Now I should talk to her."
"103224356-0-41669";"Minerva told me that the Arch-Mage Yamanu-ko is responsible for the devastation in Elinhir. She is in the Apex Tower, which is being warded by her apprentices in the surrounding towers. I should go to the towers and destroy the wards."
"103224356-0-41670";"I need to destroy the wards protecting the Apex Tower."
"103224356-0-41673";"Sara cast a barrier spell on the core to stabilize it. I should take her portal out of the staff and meet her outside."
"103224356-0-41674";"I destroyed the wards. I should meet Minerva at the base of the Apex Tower and talk to her."
"103224356-0-41675";"I made it to the base of the Apex Tower. I should wait while Minerva dispels the ward."
"103224356-0-41676";"The ward has been taken care of. Now I should enter the Apex Tower and locate Yamanu-ko."
"103224356-0-41677";"I should defeat Yamanu-ko and end the threat to Elinhir."
"103224356-0-41678";"I found a strange gem in the Dwarven ruin of Mtharnaz. I should bring it to Hermaeus Mora at the Seeker's Archive."
"103224356-0-41679";"I found a Dwemer lexicon in the ruins of Rkhardahrk. I should take it to Hermaeus Mora in the Seeker's Archive."
"103224356-0-41680";"I found a stone with unusual letters carved into it in Zalgaz's Den. I should bring the rubbing of the letters to Hermaeus Mora in the Seeker's Archive."
"103224356-0-41681";"I need to return to the Star-Gazer Observatory and speak with Hara once more to see what we need to do next."
"103224356-0-41682";"The Thief spoke of Kelmen Locke, a sorcerer who may know something about the atronachs. He was captured by dangerous mercenaries who plan to turn him over to the Serpent. They are holding him in Haddock's Market."
"103224356-0-41683";"I found Kelmen Locke being held by Greycloak mercenaries at Haddock's Market. I should talk to him about taking control of the atronachs."
"103224356-0-41684";"Kelmen Locke has given me a gem that will allow me to bind three of the monarch atronachs. He believes they will be able to tell us how the Celestial Serpent gained control of the atronachs."
"103224356-0-41685";"The monarchs confirmed that there is a fourth atronach, created by the Serpent. I should talk to Kelmen Locke about this news."
"103224356-0-41686";"The Serpent has created an atronach that draws on the powers of the other three. I should find and defeat the monarch air atronach, created by the Serpent."
"103224356-0-41687";"I defeated the Serpent's monarch air atronach. I should speak to Kelmen Locke."
"103224356-0-41688";"I defeated and bound the monarch atronachs. I should meet Kelmen Locke at the summoning site."
"103224356-0-41689";"I should use the foci at the ritual site to consult with the monarch atronachs about the Serpent's plans."
"103224356-0-41690";"Sara needs the staff's magicka to power a spell to gain access to its core. We should gather three types of infusions from staff shards scattered in the Spellscar."
"103224356-0-41691";"We have given Sara the three infusions she needs. She can now open the staff."
"103224356-0-41692";"Sara opened a portal to the core of the staff. I should follow her inside and help her stabilize it."
"103224356-0-41693";"I entered the core of the staff with Sara, and am now in a magical vortex populated by floating staff shards. We should make our way to the core on the far side of the vortex."
"103224356-0-41694";"Sara needs to disconnect the crystals from the core so she can cast a barrier spell to contain its growth. However, I need to protect her from the core's magical feedback as she disconnects the crystals."
"103224356-0-41695";"Before he left, Nhalan gave me a book that he believes contains a way to reverse the effects of the water in its early stages. I should go back to the researchers' camp and see if anyone can use it to help the afflicted researchers."
"103224356-0-41696";"Titus Valerius was familiar with the name Reinhold's Retreat, and even told me that the ruin lies beneath the city of Belkarth. I need to meet Titus and Kelmen at the lake just south of Belkarth to see if we can work out a way to get inside."
"103224356-0-41697";"I met up with Titus and Kelmen at the lake. I should see what Kelmen has to say about figuring out a way inside this ruin."
"103224356-0-41698";"Kelmen senses some sort of residual energy emanating from specific parts of the ruins. He suggested I look around and see if I can work out a way to manipulate the stones to reveal a passage inside."
"103224356-0-41699";"We managed to work out the riddle of the guidestones and unlock the pathway into Reinhold's Retreat just below the surface of the lake. I should head inside and see what Hara wanted us to find here."
"103224356-0-41700";"We entered Reinhold's Retreat, the mysterious ruin Hara mentioned before she disappeared. I don't know exactly what Hara wanted me to find here, but I should search for anything that might provide a clue."
"103224356-0-41701";"The Scaled Court infiltrated Reinhold's Retreat before we arrived and are present in great number. I discovered one of their leaders deep within the ruin. I should put a stop to whatever it is she plans to do."
"103224356-0-41702";"I located the Thief's Apex Stone. It's under attack by the magic of the Serpent's Corruption. Not only that, but Hara appears to be captive, along with the stone. I need to stop whatever is happening here and save Hara before it's too late."
"103224356-0-41703";"Madleena mentioned the Thief's Apex Stone when she attacked us. Kelmen believes it's possible the stone has been hidden here all this time, which suggests the Scaled Court are here to corrupt it. I should find the stone and stop them."
"103224356-0-41704";"After successfully thwarting the Serpent's attempts to take the Apex Stone, I discovered that Hara was the Celestial Thief all along. I should speak with her to see what she has to say."
"103224356-0-41705";"Nhalan told me that he opposed the bargain the Nedes made with Shada and was punished for it. His spirit can't rest until Zal'ik, the general who made the deal with Shada, is slain. I should try to find Zal'ik."
"103224356-0-41710";"I saw a vision of Zal'ik creating a barrier in the crypt to keep the Yokudan invaders out. The barrier is defended by a flesh atronach. I should defeat the flesh atronach."
"103224356-0-41711";"I defeated the flesh atronach that protected Zal'ik's barrier. I should speak to Nhalan before proceeding deeper into the Burial Grounds."
"103224356-0-41712";"Nhalan told me to find Zal'ik and defeat him in order to release Nhalan from his imprisonment."
"103224356-0-41713";"I found Zal'ik within the crypt. I should find a way to awaken Zal'ik and defeat him."
"103224356-0-41714";"I defeated Zal'ik. I should speak to Nhalan and determine if there is anything else I need to do."
"103224356-0-41715";"I should talk to Nhalan to learn more about him and the curse."
"103224356-0-41716";"I defeated the nereids that were corrupting the waters in the city and crypt wings of Shada's Tear. I should return to the research camp."

"103224356-0-41718";"Sali'ma believes that the leader of the nereids, Shada, is the ultimate source of the corruption. He believes she is in the third wing of the city. I should go there and find Shada."
"103224356-0-41719";"I should listen as Kelmen Locke talks to the summoned monarchs."
"103224356-0-41722";"Sali'ma believes that the leader of the nereids, Shada, is the ultimate source of the corruption. He believes she is in the third wing of the city. I should go there and find Shada."
"103224356-0-41723";"I found Shada. I should defeat her and end the corruption of Shada's Tear for good."
"103224356-0-41724";"An unseen force seems to have attacked and abducted Hara, who cryptically mentioned something called Reinhold's Retreat before she vanished. I should speak to Titus and see if he knows anything about it."
"103224356-0-41725";"I should talk to Sara Benele to learn more about the Mage's Staff."
"103224356-0-41732";"With the braziers lit, I must now defeat the guardian outside in order to enter the school."
"103224356-0-41733";"I completed the Trial of Fire. I should now be able to enter the school of Rahni'Za."
"103224356-0-41737";"I reunited the aspects of the Mage with the Lost One. It's now up to them to resist the Serpent's corruption. I should tell Star-Gazer Trilion what happened."
"103224356-0-41738";"The Mage's aspect gave me a relic called the Seeker's Sight, but the gems that power it have been scattered across Craglorn. I need to gather these gems to power the relic."
"103224356-0-41739";"I should talk to Ahlora about the Seeker's Sight."
"103224356-0-41740";"Now that the Seeker's Sight is whole, I need to find magical anomaly points in Craglorn and defeat the guardians to charge the gems."
"103224356-0-41743";"I recovered the gems that power the Seeker's Sight. I should meet with the aspects of the Mage at the winery near Belkarth to determine what I need to do next."
"103224356-0-41744";"Now that I've charged the Seeker's Sight, I should meet the Mage's aspects at the Star-Gazers' Observatory."
"103224356-0-41745";"I entered the Star-Gazers' Observatory and spotted Hara with the aspects of the Mage. I should talk to her and let her know what I've done."
"103224356-0-41746";"I should place the Seeker's Sight in the star map and observe what happens."
"103224356-0-41747";"Nazdura told me that Hara wants to speak to me in her quarters on the upper level of the Star-Gazer's Observatory. I should make my way there."
"103224356-0-41748";"The Seeker's Sight has shown us where we can find other aspects of the Celestial Mage. I should talk to Ahlora about our next steps."
"103224356-0-41749";"I need to locate the other aspects of the Celestial Mage."
"103224356-0-41751";"Now that I've gathered other aspects of the Celestial Mage, I should meet Valla and Ahlora at the winery outside of Belkarth."

"103224356-0-41753";"Valla told me that the Lost One abides near the Mage's Apex Stone, beneath the city of Elinhir. I can reach the Mage's Apex Stone through the city's sewers."
"103224356-0-41754";"The Seeker's Sight can help me locate the Mage's Apex Stone within these sewers. I should use it to find my way."
"103224356-0-41755";"I arrived at the Mage's Apex Stone. Now I must defeat the Lost One so that the Mage can be made whole."
"103224356-0-41756";"I should talk to the High Elf and see what she has to say."
"103224356-0-41757";"Someone in Craglorn may have a better idea where I can find Hara and the Star-Gazers."
"103224356-0-41760";"I should talk to the Thief to learn where to find Kelmen Locke."
"103224356-0-41761";"I should enter the Crossroad Tavern in Belkarth and seek out these strange High Elves the Star-Gazer told me about."
"103224356-0-41762";"I located the High Elves, but they're talking to another Star-Gazer. I should wait to speak to the High Elves after they finish talking."
"103224356-0-41763";"The High Elves claim to be aspects of the Celestial Mage. They have offered to show me what happened to them. I should watch and learn."
"103224356-0-41764";"I witnessed events as they transpired between the Serpent and the Celestial Mage. I should talk to Valla and find out what it all means."

"103224356-0-41784";"I dealt with Safa's traitorous acolytes as she asked. Now they won't be able to lend their power to the Scaled Court. I should return to Dragonstar and inform Safa that the deed is done."

"103224356-0-41788";"I defeated Gulzog the Butcher and gathered the personal belongings of some of the captured guards. I should return to Scattered-Leaves and let him know what happened to the guards."
"103224356-0-41789";"I burned the Scaled Court standards and mounted Agganor's helmet on a pike. I should return to Lashburr and let him know that I avenged him."
"103224356-0-41790";"I need to gather some personal effects from the remains of the guards so that Scattered-Leaves can give them to their families to remember them by."
"103224356-0-41791";"I defeated Arnoth and set back the Scaled Court's plans in Skyreach Hold. I should go to Dragonstar and let Nendirume know what transpired in there."
"103224356-0-41792";"I discovered that a Scaled Court exarch, Arnoth, is experimenting with nirncrux to make himself more powerful. What started as a test to assist the Scaled Court's leader, Regent Cassipia, is now just a power grab by Arnoth. I need to stop him."
"103224356-0-41795";"Now that I collected the infusions, I should meet Sara."
"103224356-0-41800";"I must now mount Agganor's helmet on a pike so that the old shaman can know vengeance."

"103224356-0-41802";"The first component used in the alchemical process to create the mantikoras comes from the scorpion matron and her nests, deep in the cave called Fearfangs. I need to find the scorpion matron so we can kill her and destroy her nests."
"103224356-0-41806";"Regent Cassipia is waiting at the progenitor mantikora's lair for my help. We must destroy the beast and the Scaled Court members guarding it so that no additional mantikoras can be created. If there are any prisoners there, I should also free them."
"103224356-0-41807";"I should talk to Regent Cassipia near Dragonstar, now that we've crippled the Scaled Court's ability to make more mantikora."
"103224356-0-41808";"I should meet Little Leaf in Ilthag's Undertower. The entrance is in the ruined tower atop the nearby hill."
"103224356-0-41809";"I met up with Little Leaf in Ilthag's Undertower. She tried to convince someone named Ilthag Ironblood to stop training trolls for the Scaled Court's army, but he wouldn't listen to reason. Now she wants me to step in."
"103224356-0-41810";"To further disrupt the Iron Orcs' ability to build a troll army, I need to find the Valley of Scars. I should head out and meet Little Leaf there."
"103224356-0-41811";"Now that I've reached the Valley of Scars, I need to locate and kill Runescriber Kulth and Armorer Uthik. The runescriber works on the west side of the valley, while the armorer's forge is located on the east side."
"103224356-0-41812";"Now that I'm inside the Exarch's Stronghold, I need to locate Braadoth's throne room. Little Leaf says it's deep inside the complex."
"103224356-0-41813";"Exarch Braadoth is dead and the process the Iron Orcs were using to empower the trolls has been disabled. I should meet Little Leaf outside and make sure she's all right."
"103224356-0-41815";"I need to enter Skyreach Hold and find out what the Scaled Court is up to in there."
"103224356-0-41816";"I entered the wamasu den and slayed the wamasu eggbearer. I should find Regent Cassipia near the town of Dragonstar and let her know that I accomplished the task she sent me to do."
"103224356-0-41817";"Now that I'm inside the ruins of Skyreach Hold, I should explore and learn more about what the Scaled Court is doing here."
"103224356-0-41818";"I put an end to Exarch Arnoth's schemes. I should exit these ruins and head for Dragonstar."
"103224356-0-41819";"Now that I've burned the Scaled Court standards, Lashburr wants me to find the vile shaman Agganor, kill him, and take his helmet."
"103224356-0-41820";"To further disrupt the mantikora creation process, Regent Cassipia has directed me to find a nearby wamasu cave. Inside the cave, I'll find a wamasu eggbearer and its nest. I need to destroy the creature and its eggs."
"103224356-0-41824";"I agreed to enter Skyreach Catacombs to try to discover the source of the dark force that has disturbed the dead."
"103224356-0-41825";"I entered Skyreach Catacombs. Crusader Dalamar believes the source of the darkness that disturbs the dead's rest can be found in the Lower Catacombs. I need to find my way there."
"103224356-0-41826";"I defeated the Gravelord and the Fallen Kings. That seems to have unlocked the door leading to the Lower Catacombs. Now I can descend into the depths and find the source of the darkness that haunts these ruins."
"103224356-0-41827";"If the source of the darkness permeating these catacombs truly is the legendary necromancer Virmaril, I need to run a gauntlet of undead to reach him."
"103224356-0-41828";"To reach Virmaril the Betrayer, I need to defeat these spirits to disrupt the soul ward that seals the door."
"103224356-0-41829";"I reached Virmaril the Betrayer. He keeps talking about taking my soul. I have to confront him and defeat him."
"103224356-0-41830";"Virmaril the Betrayer has been destroyed. Now I should find my way out of Skyreach Catacombs."
"103224356-0-41831";"I should tell Crusader Dalamar what happened within Skyreach Catacombs."
"103224356-0-41832";"Little Leaf and I have entered Exarch Braadoth's throne room. Now we have to put an end to the Iron Orc chief and to his troll guardian, Kurzoth."
"103224356-0-41833";"Ilthag Ironblood won't be training any more trolls. I should talk to Little Leaf now and see what else we have to do to stop the Iron Orcs from building an army of super-powered trolls."
"103224356-0-41837";"I agreed to take Kelmen's place in the ritual. I should meet Titus and the Thief at the Howling Sepulchers."
"103224356-0-41838";"I've entered the Howling Sepulchers. Now I need to find and enter the Sanctum of Farsight so we can help the Thief with her ritual."
"103224356-0-41839";"Titus and the Thief have begun the ritual. The Thief wants me to light the fires atop the pedestals in order to complete the ritual."
"103224356-0-41840";"The Thief's ritual is complete. Now I should observe the vision shown to us through the use of the farsight ritual."
"103224356-0-41841";"I need to meet the Thief at Loth'Na Caverns. Then we can find Regent Cassipia and stop her from becoming the Exalted Viper."
"103224356-0-41842";"I entered the Loth'Na Caverns and caught up with the Thief. She plans to sneak ahead and meet me at the top of the rise. I should follow after her."

"103224356-0-42687";"The passage to the Blessing Stone chamber collapsed. I need to clear the passage and rescue the workers before I can retrieve the Blessing Stone."
"103224356-0-42688";"Now that the passage is clear and the workers are free, I can retrieve the Blessing Stone for Lord Vivec's ritual."
"103224356-0-42690";"Archcanon Tarvus wants me to participate in the divination ritual. He told me to stand in position as the third corner of the ritual triangle and place the Blessing Stone when I'm ready for him to begin the ritual."
"103224356-0-42691";"I deactivated the Dwarven resonator and saved Gnisis' egg-hands. I should get back to Foreman Lathdar in Gnisis and catch him up on all that's happened."
"103224356-0-42699";"The egg-mine's foreman, Lathdar, is keeping an eye on things near the mine entrance. I should speak to him."
"103224356-0-42701";"I encountered a mysterious, masked warrior. I should speak with him."
"103224356-0-42702";"A frantic Dark Elf requested my aid in saving his father from marauding bandits. I should hurry to this innocent's defense."
"103224356-0-42703";"I should travel to the <<1>> in Craglorn and learn what happened to the mages."
"103224356-0-42704";"The Celestial Thief appeared before me at the <<1>> in Craglorn. I should speak with her."
"103224356-0-42705";"The egg-hands trapped within the mine are acting strangely and refusing to come out. I must enter the mine to determine what's causing their erratic behavior."
"103224356-0-42706";"A string of groundquakes have opened a breach in the mine's wall. The sound appears to be coming from that direction. I should delve deeper to find the source."
"103224356-0-42708";"I deactivated the Dwarven resonator and saved Gnisis' egg-hands. I should get back to Foreman Lathdar in Gnisis and catch him up on all that's happened."
"103224356-0-42726";"I should look for her near Dragonstar."
"103224356-0-42740";"Maj al-Ragath is waiting to speak to me once again in my alliance capital."
"103224356-0-42741";"Maj al-Ragath is waiting to speak to me once again in my alliance capital."
"103224356-0-42742";"Glirion the Redbeard is waiting to speak to me once again in my alliance capital."

"103224356-0-42748";"Maj al-Ragath presented me with another challenge: invoke the Scroll of Glorious Battle and slay the Whisperer in her empowered state."
"103224356-0-42750";"Glirion the Redbeard is waiting to speak to me once again in my alliance capital."
"103224356-0-42752";"I retrieved the Blessing Stone. Now I should return to Vivec's Palace and present the stone to Archcanon Tarvus."
"103224356-0-42753";"I need to participate in the ritual and see what it reveals."
"103224356-0-42755";"Maj al-Ragath is waiting to speak to me once again in my alliance capital."
"103224356-0-42756";"Maj al-Ragath is waiting to speak to me once again in my alliance capital."
"103224356-0-42758";"Maj al-Ragath challenged me to use the <<1>> before facing the <<2>> if I want to prove I am truly Undaunted."
"103224356-0-42759";"Maj al-Ragath is waiting to speak to me once again in my alliance capital."
"103224356-0-42760";"Tilenra gave me a tea that should alleviate Menaldinion's symptoms, but I'm only to give it to him if he agrees to make a public apology."
"103224356-0-42763";"I must destroy the Matus-Akin royal egg, wipe out the scribs that were bred to tend it, and slay the mad breedsman, Drovos Nelvayn."
"103224356-0-42764";"I wiped out the Matus-Akin kwama and killed the Dark Elf who created them. I should return to Ridena Devani and inform her of my success."
"103224356-0-42765";"I must venture into the Matus-Akin Egg Mine to find Drovos Nelvayn and his new, dangerous breed of kwama."
"103224356-0-42766";"Maj al-Ragath is waiting to speak to me once again in my alliance capital."
"103224356-0-42768";"I don't think the divination ritual worked the way Archcanon Tarvus expected. I should talk to Lord Vivec and find out if he was able to learn what he had hoped."
"103224356-0-42770";"Maj al-Ragath is waiting to speak to me once again in my alliance capital."
"103224356-0-42771";"Captain Naros suspects a nearby Ashlander camp is behind the attacks and asked me to search their camp for evidence of their guilt."
"103224356-0-42772";"I should find Captain Naros at the canton and offer my assistance."
"103224356-0-42775";"An Ashlander discovered me searching the ritual site. He hasn't attacked, so he might cooperate. I should speak to him."
"103224356-0-42776";"Ibaal claims the Ashlanders have not been attacking pilgrims and said some of his own people have also disappeared. We agreed to cooperate and he gave me the locations of pilgrim camps that he found ransacked."
"103224356-0-42777";"I found evidence that a monster, possibly the Ruddy Man, has attacked both pilgrims and Ashlanders on the road by Molag Mar. I should bring my findings to Captain Naros. She mentioned heading to the glass mine, so I should look for her there."
"103224356-0-42778";"Ibaal gave me a potion to shatter in the supposed Ruddy Man's lair that should bring the creature out of hiding. First, I must find its den within the glass mine."
"103224356-0-42779";"I found the monster's lair, but it hasn't revealed itself. Ibaal claimed the potion he gave me would drive the creature out of hiding. I should smash it to force the Ruddy Broodmother into the open."
"103224356-0-42780";"The monster was ferocious, but I prevailed. It will not harm anyone again. I should let Captain Naros know the true threat has been dealt with."
"103224356-0-42781";"Ibaal said he and his kind would be leaving soon. I should say my goodbyes before he returns to the Ashlands."
"103224356-0-42782";"I discovered evidence that the Ashlanders are making blood sacrifices, but found nothing conclusive. I should investigate their sacrifice site for any sign of the missing pilgrims."
"103224356-0-42783";"Captain Naros cautioned me against killing Ashlanders until we have hard evidence they are behind the attacks on pilgrims."
"103224356-0-42784";"I should search these camps for evidence of what may have really attacked the pilgrims."
"103224356-0-42795";"Captain Neros mentioned people were still unaccounted for. I should be on the lookout for survivors who may need my help while I hunt for the Ruddy Man."
"103224356-0-42798";"Glirion the Redbeard is waiting to speak to me once again in my alliance capital."
"103224356-0-42799";"Glirion the Redbeard is waiting to speak to me once again in my alliance capital."
"103224356-0-42816";"Maj al-Ragath is waiting to speak to me once again in my alliance capital."
"103224356-0-42829";"I should speak with <<1>> about celebrating the New Life Festival."
"103224356-0-42830";"Maj al-Ragath is waiting to speak to me once again in my alliance capital."
"103224356-0-42832";"Maj presented me with another challenge: invoke the Scroll of Glorious Battle and slay Canonreeve Oraneth in her empowered state."

"103224356-0-42834";"Glirion the Redbeard is waiting to speak to me once again in my alliance capital."
"103224356-0-42836";"Canon Llevule summoned the spirit of his ancestor. He wants me to talk to her and present Lord Vivec's questions while he maintains the connection that allows her to materialize before us."
"103224356-0-42839";"I should present myself to Lord Vivec as soon as he's available."
"103224356-0-42840";"Glirion the Redbeard is waiting to speak to me once again in my alliance capital."
"103224356-0-42843";"Glirion the Redbeard is waiting to speak to me once again in my alliance capital."
"103224356-0-42844";"Glirion the Redbeard is waiting to speak to me once again in my alliance capital."
"103224356-0-42845";"The prisoners I interviewed confirmed the Scarlet Judge's suspicions and indicated there may be hard evidence nearby. I should look for some documents to verify their claims."
"103224356-0-42850";"I found a flustered Llayne. I should find out what troubles her."
"103224356-0-42851";"The eerie tones are getting louder. I need to delve even deeper into the ruins to find the source of the sound."
"103224356-0-42852";"While Archcanon Tarvus reviews what I uncovered during my investigations, I should report to Lord Vivec and let him know I returned."
"103224356-0-42853";"I should talk to Archcanon Tarvus in his office and find out what he needs me to investigate."
"103224356-0-42854";"Archcanon Tarvus asked me to investigate three sites to search for clues concerning the source of whatever is draining Vivec's divine energy. These sites include Barilzar's tower, Balmora, and Ald'ruhn."
"103224356-0-42855";"I investigated the locations Archcanon Tarvus suggested and collected the cult's ritual bag, the Red Exiles instructions, Chodala's writings, and Barilzar's notes. The Archcanon sent me a message. He needs me back at Vivec's Palace."
"103224356-0-42856";"I returned to Vivec City. Now I should talk to Archcanon Tarvus, let him know what I found out at Balmora, Ald'ruhn, and Barilzar's tower, and find out what emergency transpired that he saw fit to send me a message."
"103224356-0-42857";"Archcanon Tarvus asked me to investigate an ancient Velothi tower now occupied by the mage, Barilzar."
"103224356-0-42858";"Nothing unusual outside the tower. I should look inside."
"103224356-0-42859";"I should find the mage Barilzar and ask him about his experiments."
"103224356-0-42860";"Barilzar won't answer my questions unless I help him complete his experiment. He needs me to activate crystals—in the proper order—while he modulates the energy flowing through his device."
"103224356-0-42861";"Whatever I did with those crystals, it seems to have worked. Maybe Barilzar will answer my questions now."
"103224356-0-42865";"I should venture into Zainsipilu to take stock of the bandit infestation."
"103224356-0-42867";"I entered Zainsipilu. Now I should search for Halinjirr's notes and the plant toxin he mentioned."
"103224356-0-42869";"Archcanon Tarvus wants me to investigate rumors of a cult operating near Balmora. I should ask around town and see if they could have anything to do with Lord Vivec's condition."
"103224356-0-42870";"I should check around town and see what I can find out about this supposed cult. Tarvus suggested I inquire at the inn, talk to mine workers, and look into a House Redoran proclamation."
"103224356-0-42871";"I need to see if I can find the mine's Crew Chief so I can talk to him. If anyone can tell me what's going on in the Shulk Ore Mine, it's him."
"103224356-0-42872";"The Crew Chief reports that some strange cultists have taken over the Shulk Ore Mine and are performing some sort of ritual. I should investigate and see if it's related to Vivec's problems."
"103224356-0-42873";"Now that I'm inside the mine, I should collect ritual items to bring back to Archcanon Tarvus so he can determine the nature of the ritual. I should also try to find out more about the Ashlander thief who interrupted the cultists."
"103224356-0-42875";"Archcanon Tarvus wants me to investigate the large number of Ashlanders gathering in Ald'ruhn."
"103224356-0-42876";"Seryn asked me to enter the Red Exile camp and look for her brother, Chodala, or at least find out where he may have gone."
"103224356-0-42878";"I found a scroll containing information about what Chodala was doing in the Red Exiles camp and where he may have gone. I should return to Seryn and tell her what I discovered."
"103224356-0-42881";"I should pour the toxin I found into the underground spring. That should destroy Halinjirr's captured crop."
"103224356-0-42882";"I claimed the missing notes and poisoned the crops. I should return to Halinjirr to inform him of my success."
"103224356-0-42884";"I should enter the Veloth Ancestral Tomb and see if I can locate Narsis Dren."
"103224356-0-42885";"Narsis Dren insists that hidden passages in the Veloth tomb lead to historic relics and untold treasure. He wants me to help him search the tomb and find the hidden passage."
"103224356-0-42886";"To proceed deeper into the tomb, we need to open the locked gate. Narsis thinks the stone tiles set into the floor form a locking mechanism of some sort. We just need to solve the puzzle to move forward."
"103224356-0-42887";"Narsis is sure there is a treasure room or vault in the ancient crypt beneath the Veloth tomb. I should help him find it."
"103224356-0-42888";"I should head back outside and let Elfbetta know that I helped Narsis complete another amazing adventure."
"103224356-0-42889";"With a new queen, the Gnisis egg mine will start producing again soon. I should have a final word with Foreman Lathdar."
"103224356-0-42890";"Halinjirr's farmhand, Falura, beckoned me over. I should speak with her."
"103224356-0-42892";"I decided to keep Halinjirr's activities in Zainsipilu a secret. I should bid him farewell."
"103224356-0-42893";"I decided to report Halinjirr to Captain Bethes in Seyda Neen. I should track this officer down and tell him about what I discovered."
"103224356-0-42904";"Foreman Lathdar demanded that Revus make good on his pledge to aid the miners. I must find the Telvanni mage and secure his help."
"103224356-0-42908";"Revus urged me to return to town while he arranges transportation for the eggs. I should tell Foreman Lathdar what's going on."
"103224356-0-42909";"Revus fears that the kwama queen might hatch prematurely. Soothing music should keep the queen sedate. Revus recommended a singer named Vigard. I should search for this bard to the south of town."
"103224356-0-42914";"I solved the puzzle and revealed the entrance to the hidden passages Narsis was looking for. Of course, he ran ahead. I should follow him and enter the Undertomb."
"103224356-0-42915";"Narsis was right about there being a hidden section of Veloth tomb. I should talk to him and see how he wants to proceed."
"103224356-0-42925";"Narsis Dren managed to lock himself behind a door in the Veloth tomb's first chamber, but I managed to set him free. I should talk to him."
"103224356-0-42926";"I should return to Eastmarch and speak with <<1>>."
"103224356-0-42927";"I should return to Eastmarch and speak with <<1>>."
"103224356-0-42935";"The Thief wants me to activate the triggers to summon a bridge across the chasm."
"103224356-0-42943";"We arrived at what looks like the final chamber in the Veloth tomb, but Narsis insists there is more to explore. We just need to locate a hidden passage. I should talk to him."
"103224356-0-42944";"Narsis wants me to examine the harp that stands on a pedestal in a prominent location in the chamber. It might reveal a clue as to how to find the entrance to the hidden passages."
"103224356-0-42961";"Maj al-Ragath presented me with another challenge: invoke the Scroll of Glorious Battle and defeat Allene Pellingare in her empowered state."
"103224356-0-42980";"Glirion mentioned someone named Urgarlag also gives pledges. I should see what she has to say."
"103224356-0-42982";"Maj al-Ragath presented me with another challenge: invoke the Scroll of Glorious Battle and defeat Kra'gh the Dreugh King in his empowered state."
"103224356-0-42987";"Glirion presented me with another challenge: invoke the Scroll of Glorious Battle and defeat Captain Blackheart in his empowered state."
"103224356-0-42989";"What I saw at the campsites adds credence to Ibaal's claim that the Ashlanders aren't responsible. The pilgrims looked like they were devoured by some sort of monster."
"103224356-0-42990";"Ibaal claims he's heard strange sounds coming from an ancestor tomb near the camps. He suspects something inside may be responsible for the recent deaths, but won't disturb the tomb. I'll have to investigate myself."
"103224356-0-42991";"The sounds coming from the ancestor tomb turned out to be a pilgrim in hiding. He might be able to tell me who has been attacking others like him."
"103224356-0-42992";"Ibaal doesn't believe that our culprit is the Ruddy Man, but suggests the tracks might lead us to where our quarry lives."
"103224356-0-42993";"We spotted the monster on the cliffs near the glass mine. It was watching us, but fled when it was detected. I should speak with Ibaal about what we saw."
"103224356-0-42994";"I discovered a pilgrim hiding in the ancestor tomb Ibaal lead me to. He claims to have survived an attack by the Ruddy Man, a monster of myth. There is no sign of the creature, so I should lead him to safety."
"103224356-0-42995";"The survivor I found is safe for now. Ibaal will want to know what I learned about the attacks from him."
"103224356-0-43001";"Benar lays slain, and I've been ambushed by his murderer. I must kill this mysterious assassin."
"103224356-0-43002";"The assassin dropped an interesting document. I should read it."
"103224356-0-43003";"It appears that Malur, not Benar, orchestrated the horrors in the Vassir-Didanat ebony mine. He plotted to frame Benar and I to avoid suspicion. I must track him down in the nearby town of Balmora."
"103224356-0-43004";"Malur is no where to be found, but the Hlaalu trade baron he reports to, Councilor Rayveth, lounges nearby. I should talk to him."
"103224356-0-43005";"We followed the tracks to a cliff face near the glass mine and the monster has appeared. I should be ready if it attacks."
"103224356-0-43006";"I must talk to Regent Cassipia outside the scorpion matron's lair."
"103224356-0-43007";"I should talk to Drelyth about what he plans to do now that he knows his family's story."
"103224356-0-43008";"To earn the Ashlander's respect, I must honor the First Ashkhans. I should seek out Farseer Kuamta to receive her blessing."
"103224356-0-43011";"Each of the four great tribes require a unique offering. I must claim four rare objects to place before the cairns of the First Ashkhans."
"103224356-0-43013";"I claimed all four offerings. I should place them near the four cairns of the First Ashkhans."
"103224356-0-43014";"I discovered what I could about the cultists, the ritual, and the Ashlander thief. I should check in with the mine's Crew Chief before I leave the area."
"103224356-0-43015";"I should seek out the tribe's Wise Woman. She might know more about the Hleran Ancestral Tomb."
"103224356-0-43016";"According to Wise Woman Asani, the Hleran Ancestral Tomb may be nearby. Unfortunately, angry spirits lurk within. I should give the news to Drelyth."
"103224356-0-43017";"I agreed to search the nearby ancestral tomb, but I'll have to find it first."
"103224356-0-43018";"I discovered the ancestral tomb the Wise Woman told me about. Now I must look for evidence of a Hleran family connection."
"103224356-0-43019";"I found Dranoth Hleran's spirit waiting for me in his personal crypt. I should see what he has to say."
"103224356-0-43020";"Dranoth wants me to take up his ancient spear—a weapon with great symbolic power."
"103224356-0-43021";"I must deliver Dranoth's spear, Calderas, to his descendant, Drelyth Hleran."
"103224356-0-43027";"I should travel to the Ruins of Mazzatun and speak to a member of the Su-Zahleel tribe."
"103224356-0-43030";"That Ashlander warned me about a tribe known as the Red Exiles. I should talk to her as she seems like a good place to start my investigation of Ald'ruhn."
"103224356-0-43031";"I should speak to Hides-the-Ashes inside the Cradle of Shadows for more information."
"103224356-0-43032";"I should enter the Dwarven ruin of Nchuleftingth."
"103224356-0-43035";"I found Vimy Lacroix. I should speak to her."
"103224356-0-43037";"I must rescue three of Vimy's compatriots, and recover Neramo's Dwemer control rod."
"103224356-0-43041";"I set Vimy's compatriots free and recovered Neramo's control rod. I should find him to discuss our next move."
"103224356-0-43042";"Neramo, Vimy and I defeated Artisan Lenarmen. Now we must find Neramo's prize, the Bthark Prism."
"103224356-0-43046";"I retrieved the Bthark Prism from the Dwarven vault. I should return to the surface to inform Neramo and Vimy of our success."
"103224356-0-43048";"I finally escaped from the Dwarven ruin of Nchuleftingth. I should deliver the Bthark Prism to Neramo."
"103224356-0-43049";"I should talk to Neramo and find out about my reward."
"103224356-0-43052";"I returned to Balmora to tell Councilor Eris that his daughter is safe and has joined the Morag Tong. If he promised to stop hiring outsider freelancers, Naryu said she'd arrange for me to meet with Veya."
"103224356-0-43053";"Narsis thinks the Undertomb must contain a valuable treasure. I agreed to help him find it."
"103224356-0-43059";"Lord Thanlen sent the ghost hunters ahead. I'll have to catch up with them at an ancient fort called Valenvaryon."
"103224356-0-43060";"Lord Vivec looks terrible! He's even weaker and more enfeebled than he was the last time I saw him. I should talk to him and see if there's anything I can do to help."
"103224356-0-43062";"Instead of confronting Chodala directly, the Archcanon suggests I return to Ald'ruhn and talk to his sister, Seryn. She was willing to help me last time and might be willing to do so again."
"103224356-0-43063";"Seryn wants to try to talk to her brother. She warned me that we need to follow Ashlander traditions in this; if I attack Chodala, it will just lead to war. I should follow her into the Wise Woman's hut and talk to her."
"103224356-0-43064";"Seryn asked me to journey to the Cavern of the Incarnate and talk to the Wise Woman. She wants me to convince her not to support Chodala's claim that he's the Nerevarine."
"103224356-0-43065";"I reached the Cavern of the Incarnate to find the Wise Woman under attack! I need to rescue her."
"103224356-0-43066";"I rescued the Wise Woman from her Daedric attackers. Now I should meet her inside the Cavern of the Incarnate and talk to her about Chodala's claim."
"103224356-0-43067";"The Wise Woman said we need knowledge to discredit Chodala's claim. She gave me grave dust so I can commune with the spirits of the Incarnates—failed Nerevarine from previous generations—to build an argument against Chodala."
"103224356-0-43068";"Azura, the Daedric Prince of Dawn and Dusk, manifests from the great statue and commands that I speak with her."
"103224356-0-43069";"The Ashlander tribal council is meeting inside Skar in Ald'ruhn. I should go inside so I can help Seryn convince the tribes that Chodala isn't the Nerevarine."

"103224356-0-43071";"Since I can't speak in the Ashlander council, I need to provide Seryn with the proper scroll at the proper time. Hopefully, the examples each scroll demonstrates will convince the tribes not to accept Chodala as the Nerevarine."
"103224356-0-43072";"Chodala refused to bow to the Wise Woman's decision and revealed that the staff protects him from harm. He ordered the Red Exiles to destroy the council of tribes. I need to protect the tribe members and stop the Red Exiles."

"103224356-0-43075";"Azura urged me to return to Vivec's Palace immediately. I need to see how Vivec's doing while Seryn tracks down her brother, Chodala."

"103224356-0-43085";"The ruins lead to a natural cavern thick with vines and ribbons of blood red rock winding through the stone. Filand said most of the captives are forced to extract the red mineral. I should search for more captives and free whomever I can."
"103224356-0-43086";"A fearsome looking Reachman is gathering up more captives to take to the Forge. Filand told me this is as good as a death sentence. I need to stop him."
"103224356-0-43087";"My way is blocked by a hulking, stone-skinned minotaur who made short work of the rebels attempting to push past him. I will have to defeat the monster if I hope to reach the Forge and put a stop to the Reachmen's plans."
"103224356-0-43088";"The Reachmen and minotaurs are defeated and the Forge is quiet once more. It seems Filand was brought here to be sacrificed. He should be relieved to know he and his fellows are safe. I should see how he's holding up."
"103224356-0-43089";"Rena Hammerhands, one of the captives I freed, has convinced many of her fellow prisoners to take up the weapons of the Forge and turn them against their oppressors. I should help them as I search for the Forge and the Reachman behind all this."

"103224356-0-43091";"The hagraven has taken notice of my approach to the ruins occupied by the Reachmen. She has summoned a large creature to block my path. It resembles an animal, but is made from tangled vines and barbs. I'll have to destroy it to pass."
"103224356-0-43092";"I destroyed the large vine creature the hagraven summoned, but the victory was short lived as Filand was snatched away by a harpy and these woods are still crawling with other primal beings under her command. <<1>> won't let me pass without a fight."
"103224356-0-43093";"I should speak to <<1>> and learn anything I can about the threats I'll face in this valley."
"103224356-0-43094";"I defeated the monstrous minotaur guardian barring my path to the Forge. There I hope to find survivors and the leader of this brutal band, so that I can put an end to the atrocities being committed here."
"103224356-0-43097";"The Reachman patriarch, Gherig Bullblood, is offering blood sacrifices to the Bloodroot Forge to fuel its operation. I must stop him before anyone else loses their life to this madness."
"103224356-0-43098";"I have slain Gherig Bullblood and his attendants, but the bloodshed has stoked some power in the Forge. A monstrosity of fused metal and stone has emerged from it intent to kill. I must destroy this bloodthirsty abomination."

"103224356-0-43106";"Solving the unusual Daedric puzzle revealed a golden skull in a hidden chamber. Narsis grabbed it and another passage opened. I should talk to Narsis and see what he thinks of all this."

"103224356-0-43118";"I defeated the enemy general, sending the Reachmen and minotaurs into a rout. The day is won, but the cost was high. I should speak to Eerika Skjoralmor about what is to come next."
"103224356-0-43119";"The Hall of the Dead is blocked by Reachmen conducting some sort of unholy ritual. I must defeat these shamans and whatever spirits they have conjured threatening the Hall of the Dead."

"103224356-0-43121";"I have spotted the enemy's Siege Master. Killing her would hamper the Reachmen's plans to breach Falkreath's defenses."
"103224356-0-43122";"I defeated the enemy siege master, but Falkreath's main gate is still under attack. The Reachmen are using a massive beast as a living battering ram. I will have to kill it before the defenders can unbar the gate and allow me to enter the city."

"103224356-0-43124";"The spirits called by the Reachmen have possessed the Nord dead and are attacking the living. The Hall of the Dead must be cleansed of this new menace in order to reach the Jarl's Hall."
"103224356-0-43125";"With the way clear, the survivors can reach the Jarl's Hall. Eerika asked me to join the defenders there for what will be Falkreath's last stand."
"103224356-0-43126";"The enemy warlord, a fearsome minotaur, breached the Jarl's Hall and slew the Jarl in an instant. It'll demolish what is left of the hold if it isn't stopped soon."
"103224356-0-43142";"I found several deranged egg-hands, all of whom were babbling about a strange song. I'll need to delve deeper into the mine if I'm to find out where this ""music"" is coming from."
"103224356-0-43145";"I found the corpse of the kwama's queen, killed by her own workers. While I was examining the remains, another crazed egg-hand appeared. I should see what he has to say."

"103224356-0-43151";"I encountered a powerful barrier, erected by a Dwarven machine, that's blocking my progress. I'll need to find some way to get past this strange obstacle."
"103224356-0-43156";"Gavros utilized a Daedric alchemical formula to turn people into something resembling ebony. I should claim the scroll containing the formula before it falls into the wrong hands."
"103224356-0-43157";"The Dark Elf, Revus, needs my help to fix the Dwarven resonator. I must set the valves in the correct position, then pull the release lever. The egg-hands have been humming a song since I arrived. Maybe there's a clue hidden in the melody."
"103224356-0-43160";"I found even more incriminating documents describing Gavros's experiments. I must find this mysterious alchemist."

"103224356-0-43171";"I killed Malur and reacquired the formula. I should return to Rayveth to resolve this business. He will likely ask for the scroll. I must decide what to do with this powerful document."
"103224356-0-43172";"I decided to destroy the Daedric scroll. I should discuss my reward with Rayveth. The payment may be significantly reduced, but he still owes me something."
"103224356-0-43173";"I dealt with Malur. The Daedric formula rests on a table in his bed chamber. I should take it back."
"103224356-0-43174";"I fixed the Dwarven resonator and liberated the egg-hands. I should speak to the Dark Elf mage, Revus, and find out why this happened."

"103224356-0-43213";"It looks like Barilzar completed the construction of the tonal inverter. I should retrieve it from his work table."
"103224356-0-43214";"I received the tonal inverter and instructions on how to use the device from Barilzar. Now I should return to the Archcanon's office in Vivec City and let Archcanon Tarvus know that we have a way to disrupt Chodala's power."
"103224356-0-43215";"Archcanon Tarvus is holding Seryn. I should talk to him to let him know I have Barilzar's device and convince him to allow Seryn to help me use it against Chodala."
"103224356-0-43216";"Seryn says that her brother and a few of his followers have taken refuge in a shrine to the Daedric Prince Malacath. I should meet her there."

"103224356-0-43224";"I used Sunna'rah as the Archcanon suggested, but something's wrong! It's hurting Vivec, not helping him! Why has the Archcanon betrayed us?"
"103224356-0-43225";"Seryn thought quickly and used the tonal inverter to once again stop Sunna'rah. I should talk to her and see if we can make sense of what just happened."
"103224356-0-43226";"The royal egg is preparing to hatch. I must plant it in the nursery chamber before that happens. Kwama workers will almost certainly attack. I should be prepared to fight."

"103224356-0-43314";"The Council rejected Sun-in-Shadow's petition for advancement. One of the Council Mouths, Ralasa Delvi, seemed pleased with the verdict. I should inform Sun-in-Shadow of the Council's decision."

"103224356-0-44099";"I stopped the ritual and broke the spell that was making Stibbons and the others dance. Now I need to return to Lady Laurent's camp."
"103224356-0-44100";"I made it back to the camp. I should talk to Lady Laurent and make sure everyone is all right."
"103224356-0-44101";"I saved Lady Laurent's apprentices and man-servant from the clutches of a Daedric priest. She found some scrolls in the ruins, however, and wants Stibbons to read them. I don't know if that's wise, but I should talk to her and collect my reward."
"103224356-0-44102";"We learned a few things about House Redoran during our investigation of Arenim Manor, but the most significant detail might be that Councilor Dolvara participated in Ulran's trial. I should discuss this with Naryu."

"103224356-0-44128";"I saved Azura's oracles, but the specifics of the Daedric plot remain unclear. I should speak with Rhea to conclude our adventure."
"103224356-0-44160";"I captured one of the strange spiders from the ruins. I should return to Lady Laurent's camp so we can test the potency of her tea."

"103224356-0-44187";"I managed to convince the guard to let me into Tel Aruhn. I should make my way to Magister Gothren's chambers."
"103224356-0-44188";"I witnessed an argument between Gilan and his son, Mils. If I speak to Mils, perhaps he can shed some light on what he and his father were arguing about."
"103224356-0-44190";"Mils seems to resent his father and has no interest in sharing the details of their relationship. However, he directed me to his sister, Neria, who works at the Balmora stables. She may be more willing to speak to me about Gilan."
"103224356-0-44191";"Councilor Eris asked me to investigate the disappearance of his daughter, Veya. He suggested I start by talking to Captain Brivan before I try to track down some of her friends around the town of Balmora."

"103224356-0-44274";"Llayne and I hatched a plan to squeeze information out of one of Savarak's coconspirators, Nerandas. I must travel to the wharf outside Vos and impersonate one of Savarak's henchmen. Nerandas might just share some important information with me."

"103224356-0-44609";"The mage entered the ruins, but there appears to be a magical barrier that I can't pass through. I should return to Stibbons and use the signal wand to summon Lady Laurent."

"103224356-0-44650";"<<1>> told me a bit about the holiday celebrating a pivotal battle of Pelinal Whitestrake against the Ayleids. She said the next step would be to symbolically follow his footsteps by coating my head with blood."

"103224356-0-44657";"I arrived in Nchuleftingth. Now I should seek out Neramo's bodyguard and assistant, Vimy Lacroix."
"103224356-0-44658";"I rescued Seythen Rendo from a roost of troublesome winged twilights. He ran on ahead, toward Vos. I should catch up to him and make sure he makes it home."

"103224356-0-44686";"I defeated Wakener Maras, but had to kill Nevena after she attacked me alongside him. I can see a diary nearby that they were attempting to burn. I should collect it for Tythis."
"103224356-0-44687";"It might be worth talking to Ralasa to learn more about her motivations for obstructing Sun-and-Shadow's promotion."
"103224356-0-44689";"I found the ""stolen goods."" Most of it was escaping Khajiit slaves who had paid the bandits to help them get away from Telvanni lands."

"103224356-0-44783";"A projection of a High Elf woman has appeared. I should speak to her."
"103224356-0-44784";"Lilatha, a Psijic mage, believes she can discover the location of the Daedric artifact, but she needs two powerful objects to do so. I can find the Anuic Lantern in Khenarthi's Roost, and the Liminal Lens in Craglorn's Howling Sepulchers."
"103224356-0-44785";"Bonafryd admitted that she's been following me. Now she wants to accompany me in Lilatha's boat. I must decide whether or not to bring her along."

"103224356-0-44794";"Wenridil's shadow attacked, but failed to land a killing blow. I must defeat this monstrosity before it completes its mission."

"103224356-0-44804";"Lilatha's shadow came to life. It no doubt seeks to kill her. I must defeat this creature to defend Lilatha and the Obscuros."
"103224356-0-44805";"It appears that my former ally, Bonafryd, is responsible for the shadow murders. I must defeat her and the shadow if Lilatha and I plan to make it out of this ruin alive."
"103224356-0-44806";"Lilatha and I managed to defeat Bonafryd and her shadowy minion. Now that Lilatha is safe, I should reassemble the Obscuros device."
"103224356-0-44807";"I reassembled the Obscuros. Now we can activate it and see if it shows us the location of the Daedric artifact."
"103224356-0-44808";"The Obscuros showed us several images of the Clockwork City. I should talk to Lilatha to see if she can elaborate on what we've witnessed."
"103224356-0-44810";"Lilatha believes that the mysterious Daedric artifact we've been seeking is somewhere inside the Clockwork City. We should discuss our next move."
"103224356-0-44811";"I told Lilatha about my adventures in the Clockwork City, and the Daedric plot brewing there. We should discuss our next move."
"103224356-0-44812";"I told Lilatha that I thwarted Nocturnal's plot in the Clockwork City, but she seems convinced that there are more Daedric horrors yet to come. I should talk to her about what comes next."
"103224356-0-44814";"I gave Librarian Bradyn the rubbing. Now I should talk to him and ask what happens next."
"103224356-0-44817";"Narsis seems disappointed that we didn't find anything significant down here. I should talk to him."
"103224356-0-44818";"The Bursar of Tributes requested I acquire pieces of ornate armor from Clockwork City and beyond to add to the Blackfeather Court's collection of glittering and gleaming objects."
"103224356-0-44819";"I collected ornate pieces of armor for the Blackfeather Court. I should bring them to the Bursar of Tributes and claim my reward."
"103224356-0-44822";"Provost Varuni asked me to find Chancellor Gascone. She seems confident that I'll find him in his rectory in the west wing of the Clockwork Basilica."
"103224356-0-44823";"I told Varuni about Gascone's death. I should speak to her to gain my reward."
"103224356-0-44826";"I discovered a Nocturnal Shrike in Chancellor Gascone's office. She seemed to be looking for something. I also found a farewell memorandum penned by Gascone. I should tell Varuni about all I've seen."
"103224356-0-44827";"Varuni urged me to find Proctor Luciana. The battlemage might be able to help me find Gascone. She should be just outside the Clockwork Basilica."
"103224356-0-44828";"Artificer Dalomar lent me his prized tracker, a nix-hound fabricant called Snuffler. I should let Snuffler smell Gascone's note to help it pick up the scent."
"103224356-0-44833";"The nix-hound fabricant, Snuffler, picked up Gascone's scent. I should follow it."
"103224356-0-44843";"Vimy asked me to look for her compatriots, who are scattered through the ruins. I should start by finding <<1>>."
"103224356-0-44844";"I rescued <<1>>. I should keep looking for additional survivors."
"103224356-0-44845";"I rescued <<1>>. I should keep looking for additional survivors."

"103224356-0-44852";"Snuffler picked up Gascone's scent once again. I should follow it."
"103224356-0-44857";"I must find the Anuic Lantern."
"103224356-0-44858";"It looks like someone took the Anuic Lantern before I arrived. I should look for any clues that might lead me to the item."
"103224356-0-44859";"It appears that bandits raided the shipwreck ahead of me, then turned on each other. I found a note on a dead bandit pointing to Hazak's Hollow. Hopefully the Anuic Lantern is still there."
"103224356-0-44861";"I collected the items Lilatha requested, now I must find the boat she promised. It should be moored somewhere just outside Vulkhel Guard."
"103224356-0-44862";"A Dragon Priest in the Howling Sepulchers probably guards the Liminal Lens. I must defeat this undead abomination and take the lens for Lilatha."
"103224356-0-44864";"Bonafryd appeared as soon as I arrived at Lilatha's boat. I should talk to her to figure out what this is about."
"103224356-0-44895";"The Obscuros is working! The device appears to be showing us the location of the Daedric artifact."
"103224356-0-44920";"Wenridil confessed that the loss of her shadow has weakened her in some way. Nonetheless, she offered me her notes as a token of appreciation. I should go collect them from the planter nearby."
"103224356-0-44921";"Neelo offered me his notes on the Daedric artifact. I should collect them before I leave Stormhold."
"103224356-0-44922";"I should speak to the Mages Guild adept who directed me to Adeber's corpse. He'll no doubt want to arrange a proper burial."
"103224356-0-44923";"I found the bandit's hideout in Hazak's Hollow. Now I must find the stolen Anuic Lantern."
"103224356-0-44931";"Terari and I performed the experiment to transfer Sovor's soul into the factotum and free Bolin's spirit. It appears that the procedure was a success. I should speak to Terari about the results."
"103224356-0-44932";"I found signs that Terari and her failed experiment are in the area. I should concentrate my efforts on a more thorough search of the area."
"103224356-0-44933";"I have located <<1>> in a derelict laboratory. I should speak to her about Sovor's request."
"103224356-0-44934";"Sovor told me that searching for Terari's failed experiment may be the best means of finding her. He's provided me with the Apostle's best guess as to where it might be. I should search the area for signs of the experiment and Terari."
"103224356-0-44939";"Terari revealed that her experiment was an attempt to save her lover's life by installing his soul in a factotum. She was successful, but the process drove him mad. I agreed to destroy it and retrieve the black soul gem holding Bolin's soul."
"103224356-0-44940";"I destroyed the factotum housing the black soul gem containing Bolin's soul. I should extract it from the wreckage and return to Terari."
"103224356-0-44941";"I retrieved the black soul gem containing Bolin's soul from the wreckage of his machine body. I should bring it to Terari as soon as possible."
"103224356-0-44942";"It appears Sovor has convinced Terari to perform her experiment once again and she's preparing another factotum for his procedure. She'll want to know that I have Bolin's black soul gem."
"103224356-0-44943";"Terari is going to attempt to transfer Sovor's soul into a factotum and release Bolin from the black soul gem. I have agreed to assist in case things spin out of control again. I should initiate the procedure once I'm prepared."
"103224356-0-44954";"I have all the resources. I should deliver them to <<1>>."
"103224356-0-44955";"I should harvest sources of water and see if I can find <<z:1>>. I also need to collect <<z:2>> in the Halls of Regulation."

"103224356-0-44995";"I should harvest runestones in Clockwork City to see if I can find <<z:1>>. I'll also need to collect runelights in a mysterious realm."
"103224356-0-45004";"I have all the resources. I should deliver them to <<1>>."
"103224356-0-45005";"I should harvest sources of  alchemy plants in Clockwork City and see if I can find herbalist's satchels. I'll also need to collect <<z:1>> in the Everwound Wellspring."
"103224356-0-45035";"I destroyed the shadow array and freed the trapped souls. Now I should find Adjunct Daro, return the perception tabulator, and tell him what happened to Acolyte Variah."
"103224356-0-45036";"I came across some unusual scarecrows while searching the Shadow Cleft. I should use the perception tabulator on them and see what happens."
"103224356-0-45039";"We successfully navigated the Evergloam and found our route to the Cogitum Centralis. I should talk to Luciana about our next move."
"103224356-0-45040";"I should talk to Sotha Sil to claim my reward."
"103224356-0-45043";"I should search Gascone's office for clues. He might have left something behind that explains where he went."
"103224356-0-45044";"I need to talk to former Chancellor Gascone to see if he knows how the Whispering Shadows cultists are moving through the city. We may be able to use their own methods against them."
"103224356-0-45045";"I learned that Whispering Shadows cultists use portals called Gloaming Gates to navigate the city in secret. Luciana and I could use these gates to reach the Cogitum Centralis—and Sotha Sil. I should inform Luciana."
"103224356-0-45046";"Luciana and I decided to split up and explore separate Gloaming Gates. I must travel to the eastern reaches of the Radius to find one of these gates."
"103224356-0-45047";"I must seek out the legendary Dark Elf mage, Divayth Fyr, in the Mournhold Tribunal Temple."
"103224356-0-45048";"Divayth told me that the entrance to Clockwork City waits just ahead. I should delve deeper into the cavern."
"103224356-0-45049";"I discovered an ornate clockwork globe, housing a miniature Clockwork City. I should use the device to enter Sotha Sil's realm."
"103224356-0-45050";"Divayth Fyr and I arrived in a remote, underground section of the Clockwork City. Divayth Fyr seems concerned. I should stand ready to defend against any attack."
"103224356-0-45051";"Divayth Fyr's shadow suddenly came to life and attacked its owner. It did not strike a mortal blow, but Divayth is clearly weakened. I must pursue this shadowy attacker deeper into the clockwork underground."
"103224356-0-45052";"Divayth's treacherous shadow led us into a room guarded by clockwork factotums. I must defeat them to clear the way forward."
"103224356-0-45053";"Defeating the factotums appears to have opened a door to the next section of the clockwork underground. I must continue my search for Divayth's shadow."
"103224356-0-45054";"In his weakened state, Divayth Fyr cannot safely bypass the clockwork underground's defenses. I must move ahead and find a way to shut down the traps so he can travel safely through the halls."
"103224356-0-45055";"I should find a trap release switch and throw it. It might disable the first array of traps."
"103224356-0-45056";"I should find a second trap release switch and throw it. Hopefully it will deactivate any additional traps."
"103224356-0-45058";"A slightly stronger Divayth Fyr arrived shortly after I disabled the final traps. We have to keep moving forward. His shadow must be nearby."
"103224356-0-45059";"We finally caught up to Divayth's Shadow. Now we must defeat it so Divayth Fyr can reclaim his lost power."
"103224356-0-45060";"With Divayth's help, I beat the treacherous shadow into submission. I must defend Divayth as he attempts to recover his power."
"103224356-0-45061";"A fully restored Divayth Fyr defeated the last of the factotums, allowing us to escape the Pneumatic Forge. We should make our way to the surface."
"103224356-0-45062";"We finally reached the surface of the Clockwork City! Divayth Fyr suggested we take the road to the Brass Fortress—Sotha Sil's seat of power. I should make my way there."
"103224356-0-45063";"An imposing clockwork mage confronted us outside the gates to the Brass Fortress. She made it clear that she disapproves of Divayth's presence. I should try to defuse the situation."
"103224356-0-45064";"Protor Luciana Pullo, leader of the Clockwork Apostles, told me that all newcomers to the Brass Fortress must be sponsored before they can gain full access. Perhaps Divayth Fyr can act as my sponsor. I should speak with him."
"103224356-0-45065";"Divayth Fyr may be able to sponsor me for Brass Fortress access. I should speak with him outside the gates."
"103224356-0-45069";"Sherizar, a Clockwork Apostle initiate who hopes to be selected as this year's apprentice, asked me to accompany her to the entrance to the Wellspring."
"103224356-0-45070";"Lector Naril selected Sherizar to be this year's apprentice and invited the rest of us to come inside. I should enter the Everwound Wellspring and talk to him."
"103224356-0-45071";"Lector Naril wants to show off the wonders of this oasis. I should follow him."
"103224356-0-45072";"Lector Naril finished his tour and noticed that Sherizar has wandered off. I should talk to him."
"103224356-0-45073";"Lector Naril wants me to find Sherizar and bring her back so he can get her started on her new duties here in the Everwound Wellspring."
"103224356-0-45074";"I found Sherizar in one of the Wellspring's fungal workshops. I should talk to her and see what she's up to."
"103224356-0-45075";"Sherizar asked me to help her get past the factotums so she can talk to her old friend, Chirrhari, who also currently serves as one of Lector Naril's apprentices."
"103224356-0-45076";"Chirrhari suggested we bring a few samples of her fungi to another apprentice named Idrono. It might help endear us to him and get him to answer Sherizar's questions. But she stressed that we only bring him the safe mushrooms."
"103224356-0-45077";"We gathered the safe mushroom samples as Chirrhari requested. Now we need to deliver them to Apprentice Idrono."
"103224356-0-45078";"Idrono suggested that Apprentice Ohtowen might know more about the apprentices selected since Gathal's death. To reach her, we need to traverse the sunless garden and defeat the fabricants that feast upon the dead plants."
"103224356-0-45079";"We need to cross the Sunless Garden to talk to Apprentice Ohtowen. Apprentice Idrono warned us to watch out for the fabricants that invaded his garden as we pass through that area."
"103224356-0-45080";"Ohtowen suggested there might be evidence of the other apprentices in Lector Naril's private workshop. A broken vent is our best way to reach the restricted area."
"103224356-0-45081";"We entered Lector Naril's restricted area. Sherizar suggested we examine his notes to see if he makes any mention of the apprentices that appear to be unaccounted for."
"103224356-0-45082";"Lector Naril's notes indicate that the Wellspring is fueled by the life force of the missing apprentices. I should follow Sherizar into the Simulated Sunlight Atelier and see what she thinks about all this."
"103224356-0-45083";"I have to stop Lector Naril's mad plan to sacrifice Sherizar and myself in order to fuel the simulated sunlight that keeps the plants alive."
"103224356-0-45084";"I defeated Lector Naril. Now I should talk to Sherizar and decide what to do with the simulated sunlight inductor."
"103224356-0-45085";"I advised Sherizar to call for volunteers to sacrifice themselves to keep the inductor running and the Wellspring producing food."
"103224356-0-45086";"I advised Sherizar to shut down the inductor. No amount of food is worth sacrificing vibrant, healthy lives."
"103224356-0-45109";"An alarm sounded in the Machine District. I should meet Luciana back at the Clockwork Basilica to figure out what is going on."
"103224356-0-45116";"Odd, talking crows took up residence in the Brass Fortress while I hunted Gascone. I need to learn more about their motives and habits. I should ask someone in the city if they know more. The Chancel of Transaction might be a good place to start."
"103224356-0-45117";"Divayth revealed a secret door behind the waterfall that leads to a cavern deep beneath Mournhold. We must navigate this cave network to find the Clockwork City entrance."
"103224356-0-45118";"I entered the Gloaming Gate and found myself in the Evergloam—the realm of the Daedric Prince, Nocturnal. I need to look for other portals that might lead me to my destination: the Cogitum Centralis."
"103224356-0-45119";"An imposing Nocturnal Shrike, Nightmaiden Viriana, captured Luciana. I must defeat this Daedric creature to free my companion."
"103224356-0-45120";"I defeated Nightmaiden Viriana. I should follow Luciana through the nearby Gloaming Gate. Hopefully this one leads back to the Clockwork City."
"103224356-0-45121";"When I'm ready to begin my investigation, I should enter the mysterious portal."
"103224356-0-45122";"Now that I'm inside the Shadow Cleft, I should look around for Acolyte Variah and try to determine the nature of this place."
"103224356-0-45123";"Acolyte Variah asked me to destroy the shadow array that keeps her and the other souls trapped within the scarecrows. I should locate it and destroy it to deal a blow to Night Sister Kamira."
"103224356-0-45125";"The people of Clockwork City have started to gather outside the Basilica. Some appear panicked. I should talk to Luciana about how to proceed from here."
"103224356-0-45126";"I have agreed to do battle in the Bloodroot Forge. To be truly Undaunted I must destroy <<1>>, <<2>>, and the Earthgore Amalgam."
"103224356-0-45127";"I defeated the Dreadhorn clan who occupied the Bloodroot Forge. I should find <<1>> in my alliance's capital city."
"103224356-0-45128";"<<1>> presented me with another challenge: read the Scroll of Glorious Battle and slay the Earthgore Amalgam."
"103224356-0-45129";"<<1>> is waiting to speak to me once again in my alliance capital."
"103224356-0-45130";"<<1>> is waiting to speak to me once again in my alliance capital."
"103224356-0-45132";"<<1>> is waiting to speak to me once again in my alliance capital."
"103224356-0-45134";"I have agreed to do battle in Falkreath Hold. To be truly Undaunted I must destroy the <<1>>, <<2>>, and <<3>>."
"103224356-0-45135";"I defeated all the threats to the citizens of Falkreath Hold. I should find <<1>> in my alliance's capital city."
"103224356-0-45136";"<<1>> is waiting to speak to me once again in my alliance capital."
"103224356-0-45137";"<<1>> is waiting to speak to me once again in my alliance capital."
"103224356-0-45139";"<<1>> is waiting to speak to me once again in my alliance capital."
"103224356-0-45140";"<<1>> presented me with another challenge: defy the conquering minotaur warlord, Domihaus, by sounding the Jarl's warhorn before slaying him."
"103224356-0-45142";"Proctor Luciana has no forces to lend. Fortunately, she has another resource that might be of use—an artificer named Dalomar. She insists that he might have something to aid me in my search. I should talk to him."
"103224356-0-45166";"I decided to join Divayth Fyr on his expedition to the Clockwork City. Our journey begins at the waterfall just north of Mournhold."
"103224356-0-45173";"I can use this opportunity to ask Divayth Fyr some questions about our trip to the Clockwork City."
"103224356-0-45176";"Gascone claims to have the information I need, but he wants a favor in return. I either need to help him retrieve a mysterious contract, or convince him to tell me now."
"103224356-0-45177";"Snuffler tracked Gascone's scent to the main gate of the Brass Fortress. I must follow the fabricant out into the Clockwork wilds—also known as the Radius."
"103224356-0-45179";"According to the Nords, a distraught Gascone ran past them not long ago, tracking oil behind him. The oil masks his scent from Snuffler, but the footprints should be easy to follow. I must keep pursuing the fleeing chancellor."
"103224356-0-45180";"Snuffler led me to a pair of Nords outside the fortress. I should talk to them to see if they know anything about Gascone's whereabouts."
"103224356-0-45184";"Chancellor Gascone needs me to travel to the Mechanical Fundament to retrieve a Daedric contract. He indicated that an especially dangerous Skaafin carries the document. I must defeat this Skaafin and take the contract back to Gascone."
"103224356-0-45186";"I retrieved Chancellor Gascone's contract from the Skaafin. I should deliver it to him."
"103224356-0-45187";"I can use this opportunity to ask Divayth Fyr some questions about our trip to the Clockwork City."
"103224356-0-45192";"I found a wounded cultist in the ravine.  I should see if she will tell me anything about Gascone's whereabouts."
"103224356-0-45195";"Gascone's tracks led to a body and a note. I should read this note to see if it contains any clues."
"103224356-0-45196";"According to the cultist, Gascone fled west along the ravine to a place called the Ventral Terminus. I should head that way to continue my search."
"103224356-0-45203";"I found a narrow canyon leading to the Ventral Terminus. I should investigate this approach. If I can find some evidence of Gascone's passage, Snuffler might be able to pick up the chancellor's scent again."
"103224356-0-45204";"Snuffler led me to a locked door. I heard Gascone's voice coming from the door as soon as we arrived. I should talk to him."
"103224356-0-45205";"A panicked Gascone barricaded himself behind a massive door and refuses to come out. I must find another way into this mysterious facility—the Ventral Terminus."
"103224356-0-45206";"I found a second door into the Ventral Terminus. I should go inside to continue my search for Gascone."
"103224356-0-45222";"I entered the Ventral Terminus, but Gascone is nowhere in sight. I must explore this facility and to find the chancellor."
"103224356-0-45223";"I successfully filled and charged an animo core. I should remove it from its filling bracket."
"103224356-0-45230";"I activated the Imperfect and, as expected, it smashed its way forward. I should follow the machine to make sure it makes it all the way to our destination."
"103224356-0-45233";"I successfuly used the giant clockwork automaton to smash my way to a different part of the Terminus. Gascone must be around here somewhere. I should find and confront him."
"103224356-0-45234";"I elected to kill the treacherous Chancellor Gascone. I should return to Varuni and tell her what happened."
"103224356-0-45235";"Gascone yielded and left the Terminus. I must talk to him and decide his fate."
"103224356-0-45236";"I decided to spare Chancellor Gascone. I should return to Varuni and tell tell her all that's transpired."
"103224356-0-45237";"I told Varuni about my encounter with Gascone. I should talk to her to claim my reward."
"103224356-0-45240";"Luciana and I must pursue the Shadow of Sotha Sil into the mysterious Cogitum Centralis."
"103224356-0-45242";"The Cogitum's automated security system rotated the central bridge, making it impassable. Luciana believes she can override the lock, but she needs more power. I must find two nearby power terminals and activate them."
"103224356-0-45243";"A peculiar factotum appeared, calling itself Aios. Perhaps I should speak with it to see what it knows."
"103224356-0-45245";"I should follow Luciana deeper into the Cogitum Centralis."
"103224356-0-45246";"Otherworldly shadows block our way forward, and Luciana's magic is spent. We have to find another way through."
"103224356-0-45255";"I should follow Amili into the Mnemonic Planisphere to learn more about the situation."
"103224356-0-45256";"I need to collect errant stars in order to return them to the Planisphere's sky. I should search the halls surrounding the Planisphere to find them."
"103224356-0-45257";"I've collected the errant stars needed. I should return them to the Astronomer so he can place them back into the Planisphere's sky."
"103224356-0-45258";"Something went wrong with returning the stars. I should speak to Amili to find out more."
"103224356-0-45260";"The primary stars have been corrupted. I need to head to the three viewing platforms and use the calibration guides to show each star its place in the Planisphere's sky."
"103224356-0-45272";"I've returned all of the corrupted stars to their proper places in the Planisphere's sky. I should speak to Amili to find out what to do next."
"103224356-0-45273";"I should watch the stolen memory."
"103224356-0-45274";"Amili has made her choice to become the Astronomer, sacrificing her memories to do so. I should speak to her."
"103224356-0-45281";"I found a massive clockwork automaton called an Imperfect. This gigantic machine might be capable of smashing through the stone wall that separates me from Gascone. I need to activate it first. To begin, I must open and align the nearby flow valves."
"103224356-0-45285";"A peculiar factotum appeared, calling itself Aios. Perhaps I should speak with it to see what it knows."
"103224356-0-45286";"Kireth asked me to check on her brother, Raynor, in the ravine surrounding the Brass Fortress. The firepot spiders lurking down there sound particularly dangerous. Raynor might need my help."
"103224356-0-45287";"Raynor intends to drain a valuable substance from nearby Firepot Spiders. Unfortunately, they tend to explode when disturbed. Raynor created a device to suppress this behavior. I must disable the spiders so he can drain the liquid."
"103224356-0-45288";"Raynor and I successfully obtained the firepot spider oil. Now I must deliver it to Varuni Arvel. I'll find her office in the Clockwork Basilica."
"103224356-0-45289";"Neramo arrived in Varuni's office ahead of me. It looks like he already has a plan for our next move. I should speak to him."
"103224356-0-45290";"Neramo co-opted a small clockwork automaton known as a skeevaton. We can use this creature to retrieve vital information from the Brass Fortress' Depository Documatis. I should meet Neramo outside the building to activate it."
"103224356-0-45291";"I am remotely controlling Neramo's co-opted skeevaton, and must navigate it through a maze of pipes called the serviflume. The tunnels should lead into the Depository Documatis."
"103224356-0-45292";"I directed the skeevaton into the Depository Documatis. Now I must search the building for the evidence Varuni requested."
"103224356-0-45296";"I found Neramo outside the Depository Documatis. I should speak with him."
"103224356-0-45297";"While Neramo and I searched the Depository Documatis, Kireth has been conducting her own investigation on Varuni's behalf. I should see if she needs any help."
"103224356-0-45299";"Kireth suspects that one of the city constables, Baldan,  is sponsoring newcomers in exchange for bribes. She asked me to record her conversation with him. I should get into position in the storage loft."
"103224356-0-45300";"I must observe Kireth's conversation with Constable Baldan and archive their words on the memory stone she provided."
"103224356-0-45301";"Constable Baldan's henchmen knocked out and abducted Kireth! I need to see if I can get into the building where she was knocked out and save her."
"103224356-0-45302";"The door to Constable Baldan's office is locked, but I found Raynor. I should inform him of Kireth's abduction and send him for help."
"103224356-0-45303";"Raynor suggested I talk to the residents of Slag Town—a slum in the Brass Fortress. They might have an idea of where the constables would take Kireth."
"103224356-0-45306";"An Argonian named Leaps-Over-Thistle promised to find out where Baldan's thugs took Kireth if I bring her an animo core harvested from a Verminous Fabricant. I can find one of these beasts outside the gates of the Brass Fortress."
"103224356-0-45308";"I retrieved the animo core Leaps-Over-Thistle requested. I should go back to Slag Town and deliver it to her."
"103224356-0-45311";"I discovered that the constables often throw undesirables into the Mechanical Fundament—a network of tunnels beneath the Brass Fortress. I must descend into the Fundament to find Kireth."
"103224356-0-45312";"I must find Kireth in the Mechanical Fundament."
"103224356-0-45313";"Kireth believes we are very close to finding Lankin. We should keep looking."
"103224356-0-45316";"Kireth and I found Lankin. We must all exit the Mechanical Fundament as soon as possible."
"103224356-0-45317";"Raynor succeeded in finding help. Proctor Luciana, Varuni Arvel, Constable Baldan, and others were waiting for us when we emerged from the lower sections of the Fundament. I should tell Luciana about Baldan's illegal activities."
"103224356-0-45318";"In a strange turn of events, Varuni demanded that Luciana turn Constable Baldan over to her. I should speak to her to make sure Baldan faces justice."
"103224356-0-45319";"Neramo followed me to the Clockwork Registrar. I should speak to him about his plans."
"103224356-0-45320";"An appreciative Varuni finally agreed to sponsor me, Neramo, Kireth, and Raynor for citizenship in the Brass Fortress. I must report to the Clockwork Registrar to make it official."
"103224356-0-45321";"Neramo followed me to the clockwork registrar. I should speak to him about his plans."
"103224356-0-45322";"Luciana and I discovered lights capable of dissolving the Daedric shadows. We can use them to clear the way to Sotha Sil's central chamber: the Throne Aligned."
"103224356-0-45323";"We found the Shadow of Sotha Sil preparing to kill and replace the real Sotha Sil. We must defeat this creature and save the true Clockwork God."
"103224356-0-45324";"Nocturnal's fury encroaches from all sides! I need to turn the Skeleton Key and wake Sotha Sil before it's too late."
"103224356-0-45325";"I managed to wake Sotha Sil just in time. He used his divine power to cast out Nocturnal, then teleported all of us back to the Brass Fortress. It looks like Sotha Sil wants to talk to me."
"103224356-0-45326";"Luciana seems gravely wounded. Perhaps I should talk to her."
"103224356-0-45328";"I must restore power to the central rotor so I can realign the bridge leading deeper into the Cogitum."
"103224356-0-45331";"I found Kireth, alive and unharmed, but she refuses to leave. Apparently, Baldan threw another newcomer into the Fundament before her—a Khajiit named Lankin. We must find him before we escape."
"103224356-0-45334";"Constable Drados told me that a lot of the loudest crows gather around a tree near the Clockwork Basilica. I should go talk to them."
"103224356-0-45337";"I should ask around in the Chancel of Transaction. Hopefully someone there knows something."
"103224356-0-45338";"I saw the crows accosting a city constable. I should talk to him."
"103224356-0-45340";"The stolen memory has revealed that Orvas willingly gave his memories to Sotha Sil to become the Astronomer. I should speak to Amili about what just happened."
"103224356-0-45341";"Amili has refused to give up her memories and has left the Planisphere. I should speak to the Astronomer."
"103224356-0-45343";"I should talk to <<1>>."
"103224356-0-45344";"Tilelle's schematics show that both the Vapor Manifold and Distillation Initiator are in need of repair. I should collect replacement parts, including a <<1>>  and <<2>>, to fix these machines."
"103224356-0-45346";"I should enter the Regulation Chamber."
"103224356-0-45347";"I should secure the Regulation Chamber by disabling the guardian factotum. I'll then need to collect a <<1>>  in order to allow Tilelle to repair the <<2>>."
"103224356-0-45348";"I should help Tilelle repair the <<1>>."
"103224356-0-45378";"The Knave of Rooks told me that in order to get an audience with the Duke of Crows, I'd need a well-respected escort. He suggested the Knight of Marrow. This Knight should be somewhere near a waterfall in the Brass Fortress."
"103224356-0-45379";"I found the Knight of Marrow. I should talk to him."
"103224356-0-45380";"I gathered the mushrooms and stole Salas's notes, as Brengolin asked. I should give them to him next time I'm in Slag Town."
"103224356-0-45408";"I have the ""Root Liqueur"" Brengolin asked for. I should bring it to him in Slag Town."
"103224356-0-45409";"Maurice Ouren confessed that he counterfeited the Root Liqueur. He will need Wellspring Hooch from the Catalog of Rote Duplication and Port Hunding Reserve from Port Hunding in Stros M'kai to recreate the concoction."
"103224356-0-45410";"I must follow the Knight of Marrow into the Machine District. I must watch him recite his poem before we can move on to my audience with the Duke of Crows."
"103224356-0-45411";"Brengolin offered his prepared meals to his friends, and asked me to speak to him so that he can give me something as well."
"103224356-0-45412";"Brengolin requested I acquire the flank of some wild fabricants, which will likely require some hunting, and some hand-raised nix-hound meat from Bratheru Daram's larder. With or without his permission."
"103224356-0-45415";"I should speak to Divayth about his plans to discover the source of Sotha Sil's new and peculiar behavior."
"103224356-0-45416";"Divayth wants me to conduct quiet inquiries in the Clockwork Basilica. He seems convinced that the various aides who work there will know more about Sotha Sil's recent behavior. I should talk to as many as I can find."
"103224356-0-45421";"I collected a number of complaints about Sotha Sil's bizarre and annoying behavior. I should inform Divayth Fyr."
"103224356-0-45422";"Divayth Fyr wants me to find out why Sotha Sil ordered the lights removed from the loqutorium, and perhaps construct a light of our own. I'll need Neramo's help."
"103224356-0-45423";"I agreed to enter the Mechanical Fundament to look for clues. According to the aides, the factotums may have discarded some of the lamps there. Perhaps Neramo can determine what makes them so unique."
"103224356-0-45429";"It seems that Neramo has discerned the unique lamps' function. I should talk to him."
"103224356-0-45430";"Neramo believes he can build a lamp just like the broken ones we found in the Fundament, but he needs a number of very specific components. I must buy, barter, or hunt fabricants for those parts."
"103224356-0-45435";"I collected all the parts Neramo requested. I should deliver these components so he can complete our unique lamp. I can find him in the Hall of Refined Techniques."
"103224356-0-45436";"Neramo and Raynor should complete work on the lamp soon. In the meantime, I should make my way to the Clockwork Basilica and inform Divayth Fyr of our progress."
"103224356-0-45437";"Kireth arrived with the completed lamp, but she seems concerned. I should talk to her."
"103224356-0-45438";"I must make my way to the balcony that overlooks the loqutorium and place our unique light in a place where it can shine down on the stage below. Unfortunately, the upper floors are crawling with guards. I must be cautious."
"103224356-0-45439";"I placed the lamp on the balcony. I should inform Divayth Fyr."
"103224356-0-45440";"When Sotha Sil steps out on stage and begins his lecture, I must activate the lamp and observe the results."
"103224356-0-45441";"I revealed Sotha Sil as an imposter! Apparently, a malevolent shadow took his place. It fled into Sotha Sil's private rectory. I must track it down and defeat it before it gets away."
"103224356-0-45442";"I defeated the Shadow of Sotha Sil. I should speak to Divayth Fyr and see if he has any thoughts on what just occurred."
"103224356-0-45443";"A very concerned Divayth Fyr encouraged me to talk to Varuni Arvel. I should speak with her."
"103224356-0-45444";"Varuni is very concerned about the future of Clockwork City. I should talk to her to see how she'd like to proceed."

"103224356-0-45523";"Yisareh was able to speak to Caluurion's spirit after I defeated him. He has no love for the necromancer who bound him to his will and agreed to help us if we free his allies as well. Now I have to find them."
"103224356-0-45524";"I killed Orryn the Black and destroyed his Bone Dragon, putting an end to the threat he and his cult posed to Tamriel. I should speak to <<1>> about our success."

"103224356-0-45528";"I brought down the barrier preventing our passage into Fang Lair. Yisareh asked me to take the lead and seek out an area where the necromancers practice their craft. Their research may provide some insight into their motives."
"103224356-0-45530";"I found a pair of powerful undead I believe to be Caluurion's allies. To free them from their unwilling service to the necromancers I will have to destroy them."
"103224356-0-45531";"I freed Ulfnor and Sabina from Orryn's control. They confirmed that the necromancers intend to reanimate the Dragon. I must find Orryn and prevent him from completing his ritual."
"103224356-0-45532";"I found Orryn the Black in the Dragon's old roost, but I was too late to prevent him from completing his reanimation of its bones. I must destroy the Bone Dragon and deal with Orryn once and for all."

"103224356-0-45542";"We've discovered that the cult is actually being led by Zaan the Scalecaller, the Dragon Priest from whom this mountain was named. We'll have to climb even further in order to defeat her."

"103224356-0-45585";"I've spoken to the Precursor and have learned that the rest of the factotum's memory is contained in its other missing parts. I should speak to Associate Zanon about this development."
"103224356-0-45586";"Proctor Luciana ordered one of the factotums, the Clockwork Clinician, to extract information from Gascone's brain. I should see if any of the information it recovered proves useful."
"103224356-0-45587";"The Clockwork Clinician told me that I can't ""talk"" to Gascone until I retrieve a component called a tok-plug. Apparently skeevatons often steal these plugs and hide them in piles on the east side of the Fortress. I should go have a look."
"103224356-0-45588";"I'm semi-confident that I acquired a tok-plug. I should return to the Clockwork Basilica and give it to the Clockwork Clinician."

"103224356-0-45756";"An Orcish sword remains upright in the sand, even after all this time. This may be the heirloom sword of Dulza's clan, Morkul of Fell's Run. If I bring it to one of her descendants in Rivenspire, they may reward me."
"103224356-0-45757";"I located a descendant of Dulza. I should speak with him about his ancestor and the sword I found."
"103224356-0-45758";"I met Dulza's nephew, Ghakorz gro-Morkul. He's grateful I returned his clan's ancestral sword. I should discuss a reward with him."

"103224356-0-45763";"I found one sequence plaque so far. If I follow the road, there may be more ahead. If I find more sequence plaques and return them, perhaps I'll receive a reward."
"103224356-0-45764";"I found sequence plaques CCHW-04 and CCHW-03. This suggests two plaques remain. I should keep looking."
"103224356-0-45765";"I found sequence plaques CCHW-04, CCHW-03, and CCHW-02. This suggests only one plaque remains. I should keep looking."
"103224356-0-45766";"I found all four sequence plaques. Now I should return these plaques to the Clockwork Registrar in the Brass Fortress to receive my reward."
"103224356-0-45767";"The Clockwork Registrar confirmed that it wants these sequence plaques. I should ask if there's a reward for returning them."

"103224356-0-45775";"Razum-dar tasked me with asking questions around Shimmerene to gauge the mood of the locals and the newcomers in regards to the Queen's decree. I should talk to Raz and see if he has a suggestion on where I should begin."
"103224356-0-45776";"Razum-dar asked me to attend a meeting at Kinlady Avinisse's mansion. He wants me to speak to her to determine what she knows about the happenings in the monastery. He provided me with an invitation and set of elegant clothes to get me inside."
"103224356-0-45778";"Kinlady Avinisse left her guests and went into her mansion. I should head inside and speak to her."
"103224356-0-45779";"Kinlady Avinisse seemed genuinely surprised to hear that the newcomers were being killed beneath the monastery. I should report to Razum-dar outside the mansion and let him know what I learned here."
"103224356-0-45781";"Now that I'm inside the monastery, I should look around and try to find out what's happened to the newcomers and other non-High Elves that have been sequestered."
"103224356-0-45782";"Razum-dar asked me to take a look around the Monastery of Serene Harmony in Shimmerene to determine what's happening with the sequestered newcomers. I just need to wait for Raz to distract the sentry before I can slip inside."
"103224356-0-45783";"I should talk to the Ritemaster and see what I can do to help."
"103224356-0-45786";"I should activate the nearby switches. Perhaps they can break through the shadows blocking our passage."

"103224356-0-45790";"Vanus's enchanted boat deposited me near to where the Oracle dwells. The Oracle should be nearby. I should try to find her."
"103224356-0-45791";"There's a wyress inside the dwelling, but she isn't the Oracle. I should talk to her."
"103224356-0-45793";"A wyress thinks that Marieve may have sought shelter in an old wyrd site inside the Mines of Khuras. I should use Vanus's enchanted boat to travel there."
"103224356-0-45794";"I tracked Oracle Marieve to the old wyrd site inside the Mines of Khuras, but she isn't here. She left a cryptic note for Vanus. I should use the medallion of summoning he provided and call him here. Maybe he'll notice something I missed."
"103224356-0-45795";"I should talk to Vanus Galerion and find out what happens to the Oracle now."
"103224356-0-45801";"The medallion of summoning brought Vanus to my location. I should show him the Oracle's note and see what he thinks."
"103224356-0-45802";"Vanus believes the Oracle left a secret message in this cave and the key to unlocking it requires finding elemental items with some connection to air, earth, and water."
"103224356-0-45805";"According to Gascone, a wall of solid rock stands between us. If I want to find the chancellor, I'll need to come up with a way to break through this stone wall. Perhaps something in this room can help."

"103224356-0-45839";"They forced the Oracle through a portal. I should enter the portal and follow her."
"103224356-0-45840";"The Oracle appears trapped by some sort of Daedric magic and connected to the strange portal behind her. I should talk to her."
"103224356-0-45841";"I need to defeat the weavers, break the binding pinions, and destroy the center fulcrum to set the Oracle free."
"103224356-0-45842";"Marieve is free. She has enough energy to open a portal. We should leave Mephala's realm before the energy fades."
"103224356-0-45843";"I should talk to Oracle Marieve in Skywatch and make sure she's all right."
"103224356-0-45846";"An alarm sounded in the Machine District. I should meet Luciana back at the Clockwork Basilica to figure out what is going on."

"103224356-0-45863";"I might want to check on Luciana before I start my search for Divayth Fyr. I should be able to find her in her retreat, inside the basilica."
"103224356-0-45866";"I gave Brengolin the meat he requested and he rushed off to begin preparing a meal. He invited me to join him in Slag Town to see the fruits of my labor."

"103224356-0-45912";"Valsirenn suggested I find Razum-dar at the local inn and let him know what we discovered beneath the Monastery of Serene Harmony."
"103224356-0-45913";"I met Valsirenn outside the Coral Forest, but there's no sign of Razum-dar as of yet. We should enter the Coral Forest and start searching for the Kinlady and the Aldarch."
"103224356-0-45919";"We saw Aldarch Tilcalar threaten the Kinlady before she fled. Valsirenn pursued the Kinlady. I should go after the Aldarch."
"103224356-0-45923";"Now that I dealt with the Aldarch and the abyssal pearl, I should locate Valsirenn and the Kinlady."
"103224356-0-45926";"Now I need to find Razum-dar, let him know what happened in the Coral Forest and see what he plans to do with Kinlady Avinisse."

"103224356-0-45952";"A Daedric cultist channeled magicka through a pearl similar to the one we saw in the office. It drained the life from the captured newcomers. Now the pearl seems to be summoning yaghra. I need to protect Valsirenn while she deals with the pearl."
"103224356-0-45958";"Razum-dar and Valsirenn agreed to work together to discover what the Aldarch is up to. We learned that he's meeting the Kinlady south of the city, in the Coral Forest. I should go and meet Valsirenn there."
"103224356-0-45961";"Now that I'm back in the Dreaming Cave, I should consult with the Ritemaster about what we need to do next."

"103224356-0-45963";"I collected ornate pieces of heavy armor for the Blackfeather Court. I should bring them to the Bursar of Tributes and claim my reward."
"103224356-0-45964";"The Daedric barrier reacted when I held the Dawnstar gem toward it. It withdrew slightly. I should talk to the Ritemaster and find out what this means."
"103224356-0-45965";"The Ritemaster asked me to meet him in the Dreaming Cave beneath Ceporah Tower. He wants to show me something that concerns the location of the Heart of Transparent Law."
"103224356-0-45966";"Leythen suggested that a cult of Meridia was operating north of Shimmerene, but that the Court of Bedlam eliminated them. Valsirenn reminded me that Razum-dar was investigating Daedric cults. I should be able to find him in Shimmerene."
"103224356-0-45967";"The Ritemaster asked me to hold the Dawnstar gem I retrieved up to the barrier that blocks the portal. He thinks that the path beyond the barrier leads to where he hid the Heart of Transparent Law."
"103224356-0-45968";"It's time to leave the Cogitum Centralis. I can speak to everyone once I'm back in the Clockwork Basilica."
"103224356-0-45974";"Scribbles of skeevers on the walls of Shimmerene might lead me to Razum-dar's current location."
"103224356-0-45975";"The Divine Prosecution appears to be examining some strange scribbles of skeever heads on the walls of Shimmerene. I should ask them if they've seen Razum-dar."
"103224356-0-45977";"I found Razum-dar interrogating a pair of Peryite cultists. I should talk to him and ask him if he knows where I can find a priest of Meridia."
"103224356-0-45978";"Raz has a friend who belongs to the Meridia cult. He's going to make contact with her and then meet me outside the ruins of Eton Nir Grotto."
"103224356-0-45979";"You can get ornate items from delves, dungeons, or other daily quest rewards."
"103224356-0-45983";"Daedra swarm around the Oracle's dwelling. I should investigate and figure out what's going on here."
"103224356-0-45984";"I appear to be in Mephala's realm, the Spiral Skein. I need to look around and find Oracle Marieve."
"103224356-0-45994";"One of the Duke of Crows' servants, the Knave of Rooks, appeared near the Gloaming Gate. Perhaps I should talk to him."
"103224356-0-45997";"I should ask Vivienne what else she knows about Haladan's murder, and why she believes Emile is innocent despite admitting to the crime."
"103224356-0-45998";"A High Elf arrived shortly after I finished questioning Emile. I should talk to her."
"103224356-0-45999";"When he returned to Lillandril, Emile confessed his guilt to a local Lillandril Guard named Milerond. Calawende suggested I speak to Milerond to learn more about Emile's confession and see if there's anything she missed."
"103224356-0-46000";"The guard, Milerond, seems convinced that the answers I seek can be found in the nearby Saltbreeze Cave. I should search this cavern for clues."
"103224356-0-46001";"A shambling stone-skinned creature lurks near a locked door deep within the seaside cave. I must defeat this abomination if I wish to continue my investigation."
"103224356-0-46002";"The stone creature, Gerwerdel, lingered near a chest that might belong to Haladan. I should see what's inside. Perhaps it will help me gain entry to the locked room nearby."
"103224356-0-46003";"The key I found allows me to access the locked room—some kind of laboratory. I should explore this subterranean workshop. Perhaps I can discover what Haladan and Emile were doing here before the murder."
"103224356-0-46004";"I found a blind vampire hiding in Haladan's laboratory. She does not appear hostile. I should speak with her."
"103224356-0-46005";"Haladan's notes corroborate Norasea's story. Emile and Haladan treated her illness with vampirism, and Norasea's deranged companion killed Haladan. Emile's made a false confession to protect Haldan's legacy. I must speak with Emile to settle this."
"103224356-0-46006";"Emile pleaded with me to keep what I found a secret. I can respect Emile's wishes and allow him to be falsely imprisoned, or I can tell the Sapiarchs the truth, thus destroying Haladan's reputation, and potentially putting Norasea's life in jeopardy."
"103224356-0-46007";"I chose to ignore Emile's wishes and tell Sapiarch Soraturil that Emile did not kill Haladan. Emile will go free, but Haladan's reputation will be ruined, and Norasea's life will be imperiled."
"103224356-0-46008";"I chose to respect Emile's wishes and lie to Sapiarch Soraturil, confirming that Emile murdered Haladan. This will ensure the Sapiarchs don't go looking for Norasea, Haladan's friend, and keep Haladan's reputation intact."
"103224356-0-46009";"I chose to ignore Emile's wishes and tell Sapiarch Soraturil that Emile did not kill Haladan. Emile will go free, but Haladan's reputation will be ruined, and Norasea's life will be imperiled."
"103224356-0-46010";"I chose to respect Emile's wishes and lie to Sapiarch Soraturil, confirming Emile murdered Haladan. This will ensure the Sapiarchs don't go looking for Norasea, Haladan's friend, and ensure Haladan's reputation remains respected."
"103224356-0-46012";"Vivienne will certainly have an opinion as to whether I should respect Emile's wishes and let him suffer the consequences for a crime he didn't commit. Perhaps I should speak to her about it."
"103224356-0-46013";"Calawende understands the politics of the Mages Guild and Sapiarchs very well. I can speak to her to learn how my decision might affect the relationship between the Mages Guild and the Sapiarchs in Lillandril."
"103224356-0-46021";"I reached Eton Nir Grotto and located Razum-dar and his old friend Sadara-do. I should talk to her and see if she can help me make contact with Meridia."
"103224356-0-46022";"Sadara-do said that there's a Meridia shrine somewhere within the ruins of Eton Nir Grotto. She thinks we can contact her Prince once we reach that location."
"103224356-0-46023";"The vampire, Norasea, explained that the stone abomination, not Emile, murdered Haladan. Haladan's notes and my testimony could exonerate Emile. I should collect these notes."
"103224356-0-46025";"A voice has called to us from the statue of Meridia. I should approach the statue and speak to Meridia."
"103224356-0-46026";"Meridia informed me that the Golden Knight is Darien Gautier and wants me to rescue him. The Psijics can use the Dawnstar Gem to locate Darien in Mephala's Spiral Skein. I should return to the Dreaming Cave on Artaeum and inform the Ritemaster."
"103224356-0-46027";"Sadara-do confirmed that the shrine to Meridia is just inside. I should proceed with caution in case the Court of Bedlam left something behind."
"103224356-0-46034";"The Ritemaster asked me to go to Sotha Sil's study and find his acolyte, Oriandra. I need to ask her for the amplification elixir to increase the power of the Order's augury ritual cast on the pearl."
"103224356-0-46037";"I retrieved the amplification elixir from Sotha Sil's study. Now I need to bring the elixir to the Ritemaster."
"103224356-0-46038";"The Ritemaster asked me to pour the elixir into the scrying pool to amplify the augury ritual's power."
"103224356-0-46039";"The augury ritual revealed the false Aldarch meeting with two other members of a Daedric cult that calls itself the Court of Bedlam. They mentioned plans for Rellenthil, a town in Summerset. I should discuss what we saw with the Ritemaster."
"103224356-0-46040";"The Ritemaster suggested that Valsirenn and I travel to the town of Rellenthil in Summerset and talk to the Canonreeve. If anything unusual is going on there, the Canonreeve should be able to tell us about it."
"103224356-0-46041";"I should talk to Canonreeve Farmeldo and find out what's been happening here in Rellenthil."
"103224356-0-46042";"The Canonreeve said a large sinkhole opened near the city. He suggested that his son Nedoril has gotten involved with a group of young High Elves who have been meeting near the sinkhole for some reason. I should enter the sinkhole and investigate."
"103224356-0-46044";"The sinkhole opens into a network of underground caverns. I should explore them and see what I can find."
"103224356-0-46045";"While exploring the network of caverns and passages in the sinkhole near Rellenthil, I heard someone call for help. I should talk to him."
"103224356-0-46046";"Valsirenn appeared just ahead of me. She wants me to see something across the large cavern. I should talk to her."
"103224356-0-46047";"The Sea Sload left a terrible yaghra monster behind. I need to deal with the creature before it brings the entire sinkhole down on top of us."
"103224356-0-46048";"I should talk to the Ritemaster about the Sea Sloads and the Daedric Princes."
"103224356-0-46049";"Razum-dar asked me to meet him at the Canonreeve's house. He plans to deal with the Canonreeve's traitorous son, Nedoril. I should report to the Canonreeve and inform him about what we found out."
"103224356-0-46051";"Once outside, we ran into Razum-dar. I should talk to Razum-dar and let him know what happened in the sinkhole."
"103224356-0-46054";"The Ritemaster has opened a portal in the Dreaming Cave to send me and Valsirenn to Mephala's realm, the Spiral Skein."
"103224356-0-46071";"The Dreaming Cave transported me to the Spiral Skein, but Valsirenn and I were separated. I need to find her before we start looking for Darien."
"103224356-0-46081";"I found Valsirenn and freed her from a web cocoon. I should make sure she's all right before we continue our search for Darien."
"103224356-0-46082";"Calawende suggested I search Galidor's ledger to find out what dealings he had with Emile. The ledger is magically warded, but I can make it readable by learning and reciting a passphrase. Perhaps I'll find some clues in Galidor's room."
"103224356-0-46083";"I found several words in Galidor's notes that seem significant. If I say these words in the correct order, perhaps I can reveal the contents of Galidor's black market ledger."
"103224356-0-46084";"I successfully revealed the contents of Galidor's black market ledger! I should read it to determine what he sold Emile in the days before Haladan's murder."
"103224356-0-46085";"According to Galidor's ledger, Emile made a very unusual purchase: a keg filled with sheep's blood and several alchemical syringes. I should speak with Calawende. Perhaps she can shed some light on this."
"103224356-0-46086";"Now that Valsirenn and I are together, we need to find the Golden Knight, Darien Gautier."
"103224356-0-46090";"We found the Golden Knight, Darien Gautier. He's caught in a giant web and surrounded by Mephala's Daedra. I need to defeat them before I can set him free."
"103224356-0-46092";"The Dawnstar's light shredded the webs and set the Golden Knight free. Now I should talk to Darien and see if he can restore the Dawnbreaker."
"103224356-0-46093";"Now that we have Darien, we need to find a way to contact the Ritemaster so he can get us back to the Dreaming Cave. I should talk to Valsirenn outside the Spider Citadel."
"103224356-0-46094";"Valsirenn opened a portal back to the Dreaming Cave. I should use the portal so I can return to the Ritemaster and let him know what happened."
"103224356-0-46097";"Oracle Marieve sought shelter somewhere inside the Mines of Khuras, I need to find her."
"103224356-0-46098";"I need to talk to Oriandra so we can determine a new course of action in the wake of the Ritemaster's death."
"103224356-0-46100";"The Ritemaster asked me to go to his study in Ceporah Tower and check on Oriandra's progress in translating the ancient words."
"103224356-0-46101";"I should find out more about Larydel from his sister, Rinyde."
"103224356-0-46102";"Rinyde gave me enchanted daggers that will allow me to impress Alchemy, a House of Reveries sponsor. I must perform for her at the ampitheater in Rellenthil."
"103224356-0-46103";"Alchemy seems impressed by my performance. I should speak with her."
"103224356-0-46104";"Alchemy tasked me to find a gryphon feather for the mask I will wear as a Hopeful of the House of Reveries. I should look for a nest by a lake near Rellenthil."
"103224356-0-46105";"I acquired a gryphon feather. I should present it to Alchemy."
"103224356-0-46106";"I successfully became a Hopeful, a potential House of Reveries member. I should inform Rinyde and learn our next step."
"103224356-0-46107";"The first masked potential calls himself Firebird. I should play the Game of Boasts and try to learn if he is Larydel in disguise."
"103224356-0-46108";"Firebird asked me to juggle daggers while he breathes flame, so we can practice performing together. This is required before we can play the Game of Boasts."
"103224356-0-46109";"I performed with Firebird and can now ask one question. I should ask him a question that might help me discover if he is Larydel."
"103224356-0-46110";"The second masked potential calls herself Clever. I should play the Game of Boasts and try to learn if she is Larydel in disguise."
"103224356-0-46111";"Clever cannot speak while performing her act, sword swallowing. I should announce her performance."
"103224356-0-46112";"I performed with Clever, and we may now play the Game of Boasts. I should ask her a question that might help me discover if she is Larydel."
"103224356-0-46113";"The third masked potential calls himself Feathermoth. I should play the Game of Boasts and try to learn if he is Larydel in disguise."
"103224356-0-46114";"Feathermoth asked me to drum in time to his dancing. I must perform with him before he will play the Game of Boasts."
"103224356-0-46115";"I satisfied Feathermoth's desire for a joint performance. I should ask him a question to decide if he might be Larydel in disguise."
"103224356-0-46116";"I spoke with the three Hopefuls who may be Larydel. Now I should talk to Rinyde and announce my conclusions."
"103224356-0-46117";"Rinyde was not present when I arrived. Instead, Alchemy was waiting for me. I should speak to her and find out what she wants."
"103224356-0-46118";"Alchemy is aware I have been trying to find Larydel! She is now curious who I think Larydel might be. I should share my theories."
"103224356-0-46119";"Alchemy asked me to leave Larydel alone, and to inform Rinyde she should do the same. I should speak to her about finding Larydel."
"103224356-0-46120";"Alchemy said that Larydel has always envied Rinyde's talent with magic, which is why he left. I should tell Rinyde what I discovered."
"103224356-0-46122";"Rinyde decided to reveal all the performers during their audition for the Grand Maestro using magic. This could prevent innocent performers from being able to join the troupe. I can warn Alchemy about this or let Rinyde cast her spell."
"103224356-0-46125";"I agreed to work with Alchemy to absorb the spell cast by Rinyde, revealing my identity but protecting the others. I should first join the audition so Rinyde doesn't suspect anything."
"103224356-0-46127";"I agreed to work with Alchemy to absorb the spell cast by Rinyde, revealing my identity but protecting the others. I should begin the audition by juggling alongside Firebird."
"103224356-0-46128";"I agreed to work with Alchemy to absorb the spell cast by Rinyde, revealing my identity but protecting the others. I should go to my next mark."
"103224356-0-46129";"I've agreed to work with Alchemy to absorb the spell cast by Rinyde, revealing my identity but protecting the others. I should cheer Clever's performance to pump up the crowd."
"103224356-0-46130";"I've agreed to work with Alchemy to absorb the spell cast by Rinyde, revealing my identity but protecting the others. I should go to my next mark."
"103224356-0-46131";"I've agreed to work with Alchemy to absorb the spell cast by Rinyde, revealing my identity but protecting the others. I should play the drum to help Feathermoth keep his rhythm."
"103224356-0-46132";"I decided to let Rinyde cast her spell and reveal the performers auditioning for the House of Reveries. I should stand aside and watch the drama play out."
"103224356-0-46133";"Alchemy left the ampitheater after Rinyde cast her spell. I should speak to Alchemy about what happened."
"103224356-0-46134";"Alchemy has revealed that she is Larydel! She's been a member of the House of Reveries for a year, but feared telling her sister would convince Rinyde not to follow her dream. I can advise Alchemy to tell her sister the truth or to keep lying."
"103224356-0-46135";"I advised Alchemy to write a letter to her sister after she's settled in Lillandril, explaining who she really is and why she lied. I must find Rinyde and ensure she knows a letter is coming."
"103224356-0-46136";"I advised Alchemy to tell her sister the truth about who she is. I should find Rinyde before she leaves Rellenthil and make sure she stays to speak to Alchemy."
"103224356-0-46137";"I advised Alchemy to write a letter to her sister once she arrives in Lillandril, explaining who she really is and why she lied. I must find Rinyde and ensure she knows a letter is coming."
"103224356-0-46138";"I advised Alchemy to tell her sister the truth about who she is. I must find Rinyde before she leaves Rellenthil and make sure she stays to speak to Alchemy."
"103224356-0-46141";"I defeated and locked away the spirit of the Illuminus. I should inform Erudil of my success."
"103224356-0-46142";"The Illuminus contained no text. I should ask Erudil about it."
"103224356-0-46144";"Erudil mentioned that a mysterious book called the Illuminus might be the source of the enchantment. I should take a look at this suspicious tome."
"103224356-0-46151";"Leythen provided me with a rune. He says if I use it in Ebon Stadmont, he'll be able to see what I see. I need to go to Ebon Stadmont, find the ancient writing, and use Leythen's rune."
"103224356-0-46156";"Rinyde kept a journal of her interactions with her brother, Larydel. Reading the journal may help me know what to look for when interviewing the other potentials."
"103224356-0-46160";"I've convinced Talerion of Arathel's innocence. I should talk to the Mother of Rats. She'll want to know that the Divine Prosecution won't be raiding Mother's Den anytime soon."
"103224356-0-46161";"Lanarie insists that the Justiciar of Remand, Talerion, knows more about Arathel's disappearance than he's letting on. I should speak with him in the kinlady's manor."
"103224356-0-46162";"According to Talerion, the guards seized a crude map from Arathel when he turned himself in. This map might contain valuable clues. I can find a copy near the kinlady's hearth."
"103224356-0-46163";"I took a faithful copy of Arathel's map. Hopefully it will lead me to another clue."
"103224356-0-46164";"Now that I've entered the city's underground, I need to find the Mother of Rats. Perhaps the rats themselves can show me the way."
"103224356-0-46165";"I found Mother's Den, the Mother of Rats's underground hideout. I should talk to the Mother of Rats and find out what she knows about Arathel."
"103224356-0-46166";"The Mother of Rats told me about a rival group that seeks a more violent resolution to the plight of Summerset's underclass. One of her spies, Zan'hi, is looking into it. I should track him down and see if he knows anything about Arathel."
"103224356-0-46167";"Zan'hi told me a sorcerer called Mirulon took Arathel deep within the caverns beneath Shimmerene. I must navigate these caves to find him."
"103224356-0-46169";"I found Zan'hi, urging a friend to flee the underground. I should talk to him."
"103224356-0-46172";"I found Arathel. I must kill his captor, Mirulon, to aid his escape."
"103224356-0-46173";"I found some convincing evidence that clarifies Arathel's role in the plot to kill the Sapiarch. Unfortunately, Arathel ran off during the fight with Mirulon. I must track him down."
"103224356-0-46174";"I should bring Arathel back to Mother's Den where he'll be safe."
"103224356-0-46177";"Leythen's rune has allowed him to project himself to my location. I should talk to him and see if he knows what I should be looking for."
"103224356-0-46178";"I should talk to Erudil to find out what he plans to do about this enchantment run amok."
"103224356-0-46183";"I successfully gained Rinyde's attention. I should now wait to be unmasked on stage."
"103224356-0-46198";"Erudil's friend, Selynia, is standing high atop the Academy's walls. I should go talk to her. Perhaps I can find a way to break the enchantment's hold on her."
"103224356-0-46199";"Erudil's friend, Tanelwen, should be lingering in the lecture garden. I should talk to her."
"103224356-0-46201";"Erudil thinks we can break the Illuminus enchantment by convincing the victims to act contrary to their new persona. I should try this idea out on his friends."
"103224356-0-46202";"Selynia's persona, the Brave Little Scrib, isn't afraid of anything. If I can find something that frightens Selynia, I might be able to force her out of character and break the enchantment."
"103224356-0-46209";"I should read the Illuminus to see how the pages have changed."
"103224356-0-46211";"Erudil's friend, Pavo, is tucked away near the eastern wall of the academy. I should talk to him."
"103224356-0-46213";"I must talk to Silurie to learn how we plan to get inside Cey-Tarn Keep."
"103224356-0-46214";"Silurie gave me a fake mandate from the Proxy Queen that should get me inside the keep, but I must speak to Lindafwe who is controlling the Divine Prosecution's cordon, and distract her so Silurie can sneak inside."
"103224356-0-46218";"I was able to distract Lindafwe long enough for Silurie to pass unnoticed and successfully passed myself off as an investigator sent by the Proxy Queen. Now I need to find Silurie and learn our next move."
"103224356-0-46219";"Silurie's spell created two orbs of light. While Silurie follows one orb, I must follow the other and learn where it leads."
"103224356-0-46220";"Silurie's orb of light vanished into a solid wall. It may conceal a hidden room. I should check the candelabra and pedestal for a means to open it."
"103224356-0-46221";"I found a hidden room in Cey-Tarn Keep containing signs some sort of ghastly ritual took place in here. This may be where the Daedra was summoned. I should look for clues to confirm my suspicions."
"103224356-0-46222";"I found a book speaking of something called ""The Insatiable"" and signs that its summoning ritual was performed in the hidden room. Silurie will want to see this. I should find her in Cey-Tarn Keep's refectory, like she asked."
"103224356-0-46223";"Silurie has been captured by Lindafwe, the Divine Prosecution officer I met at the gate, and another Altmer dressed in their uniform. He has beckoned me over to talk."
"103224356-0-46224";"Using the evidence I found, I have convinced Hyircil to allow Silurie to lead us on the hunt for the killer. Her trail is leading us to the keep's cellar."
"103224356-0-46225";"I must follow Silurie, Hyircil, and Lindafwe as we search for the Daedra in the cellar of Cey-Tarn Keep."
"103224356-0-46226";"A monstrous Daedra appeared and snatched Lindafwe away through a portal! Silurie, Hyircil, and I must give chase through the opening before she is lost."
"103224356-0-46227";"I found evidence a mage named Teraniel summoned a monster called ""the Insatiable"" at the behest of some unknown benefactor. I should find the others and tell them what I discovered."
"103224356-0-46228";"Hyircil was injured in a fight with an unknown assailant. I should check on him and see if he can tell me more about what happened."
"103224356-0-46229";"Hyircil's attacker was the summoner of the Daedra stalking Cey-Tarn Keep, but that is a less pressing concern than saving Lindafwe before the Insatiable devours her. He told me Silurie followed them through the door to the wine cellar. I should too."
"103224356-0-46230";"The Insatiable is attempting to devour Lindafwe! I must defeat it to save her."
"103224356-0-46231";"The mage who summoned the hunger, Teraniel, escaped into a portal. Silurie asked me to chase Teraniel down while she goes back to rescue Hyircil."
"103224356-0-46232";"When Lindafwe and I exited Teraniel's portal, it closed behind us, trapping Silurie and Hyircil in the Gorge. There must be some way to rescue them. Perhaps Lindafwe will have some ideas."
"103224356-0-46233";"Lindafwe believes finding Teraniel will be our best chance of rescuing her friends from the Gorge. As we talked about where to search in this familiar ruin, she felt a ripple of magicka coming from across the bridge before us. We should investigate."
"103224356-0-46234";"Lindafwe has opened a portal to the Gorge. I need to use it to find Silurie and Hyircil."
"103224356-0-46235";"Teraniel is conducting some dark ritual using Hyircil and Silurie as sacrifices. I must stop her and save them both."
"103224356-0-46236";"Silurie and Hyiricil are safe and Teraniel is dead. Now we must escape the Gorge before Lindafwe loses her grip on the portal."
"103224356-0-46237";"We are safe, the Insatiable is defeated, and the mage who summoned it is dead. I should speak to Silurie to see where we go from here."
"103224356-0-46238";"We are safe, the Insatiable is defeated, and the mage who summoned it is dead. I should speak to Silurie to see where we go from here."
"103224356-0-46239";"As I arrived in Rellenthil, Razum-dar appeared and ran toward me. He obviously wants to talk to me."
"103224356-0-46241";"I've convinced Pavo that I can lift his curse. I should put on a show to convince him I've used my ""Daedric power."""
"103224356-0-46243";"I elected to free Lauriel's spirit. She said some unnerving things, then vanished shortly thereafter. I should return to Erator to inform him of all that's happened."
"103224356-0-46244";"Bailiff Erator gave me his blessing to search the acropolis grounds. Perhaps I can find some clues as to what happened here."
"103224356-0-46246";"The note I found indicated that a group of Elves called the Keepers were charged with protecting something in the castle catacombs. This one is carrying a key and a seal. I might be able to use them to explore further."
"103224356-0-46247";"I should use the key I found to enter the catacombs. Perhaps I'll find more answers there."
"103224356-0-46248";"A ghost suddenly appeared. I should talk to it."
"103224356-0-46249";"The ghost identified itself as Lauriel and told me that it was bound to the lower catacombs, deep beneath the acropolis. I must find a Crimson Seal to gain entry to the acropolis' nethermost depths."
"103224356-0-46251";"I discovered an ancient stone tablet. I should examine it to see what it says. It might explain how to use this golden seal."
"103224356-0-46256";"Silurie has something up her sleeve to help our search and instructed me to observe her technique."
"103224356-0-46258";"Acting out the role of Investigator Vale, Tanelwen is sure that she knows the identity of the pie thief. Perhaps if I prove her wrong, her enchantment will break."
"103224356-0-46262";"The persona that has taken hold of Glardir is clearly linked to the Illuminus's shifting and ominous text. I should confront Glardir and learn her role in this once and for all."
"103224356-0-46264";"Now that I have the Crimson Seal I can place it on the pillar opposite the Golden Seal and open the way to the lower catacombs."
"103224356-0-46267";"I banished the minotaur illusions, clearing the way to the archives' central chamber. I must defeat the source of this enchantment."
"103224356-0-46269";"Now that we're inside the sinkhole, I should consult with Valsirenn about what we should do next."
"103224356-0-46272";"Leythen thinks the translated passages about crows will help guide me through the Ebon Stadmont forest. I should refer to the passages as I search for the stone inscribed with the ancient writing."
"103224356-0-46273";"Nedoril has apparently joined the Court of Bedlam and killed one of his friends for disparaging the cult's crazy plans. I should continue exploring the caverns and attempt to find Nedoril."
"103224356-0-46274";"I've been hired as Andewen's escort through Ebon Stadmont. I should be on a lookout for anything  that can lead us to the temple, as well as protect her from any danger we come across."
"103224356-0-46275";"Andewen's translation indicates a ruin farther along the path. I should follow her to this ruin."
"103224356-0-46276";"Despite being mysteriously separated, Andewen and I found each other. I should help her look for another inscription."
"103224356-0-46277";"The second inscription has revealed the ruin's location. I should see if I can find anything in the ruin that can help Andewen."
"103224356-0-46278";"Andewen and I were separated again. I headed inside the ruin to look for her, and found a note next to a strange, glowing stone. I should read the note."
"103224356-0-46280";"The dying mer that Andewen healed has regained consciousness. We should talk with him and find out what happened."
"103224356-0-46281";"Fletch doesn't remember what attacked him, but believes his troupe may be in danger. We should speak to his troupe leader Maestro Forte about these concerns."
"103224356-0-46282";"We warned Maestro Forte about the Daedra threat. Suspecting the stones like the one we found next to Fletch, he asked Andewen and I to inspect one nearby. I should go find the northern stone."
"103224356-0-46283";"I activated the northern stone, and once again heard a woman's voice, which spoke of the future. I should speak to Andewen about these strange events."
"103224356-0-46284";"Andewen and I have discovered that we're actually in the past. I should use the northern stone to return to my own time."
"103224356-0-46285";"I took the door to the future, and arrived in a clearing during a massive storm. An older Andewen is standing next to one of the stones. I should talk with her and find out what happened."
"103224356-0-46286";"I've activated the stone, which opened the door to the temple. I must travel within the temple to stop Andewen from ever going back in time."
"103224356-0-46287";"I've entered the temple, only to be ambushed by Fletch. I should defeat him."
"103224356-0-46288";"I killed Fletch. I should find the stone I used to go to the future and use it to return to my time."
"103224356-0-46289";"A portal has opened before me, with a voice beckoning me to enter. I should go through it."
"103224356-0-46290";"I've arrived back in my time, with Fletch standing before me. I should speak to him and discovery how this is possible."
"103224356-0-46291";"I convinced Andewen to leave, thus saving her from becoming trapped. I should talk to her and collect my reward."
"103224356-0-46307";"I should speak to Andewen, the academic leading this expedition. I can find her on the other side of the forest."
"103224356-0-46319";"I convinced Talomar that he will be happier if he leaves the Royal Menagerie behind him."
"103224356-0-46320";"I agreed to help Talomar search for his indrik, Lotus. We should look around the grounds for any sign of her."
"103224356-0-46325";"We destroyed the abyssal pearls, but the Sea Sload and its hooded companion got away. I should talk to Valsirenn."
"103224356-0-46326";"Valsirenn found a way for us to exit the sinkhole. I should take advantage of it and get out of here."
"103224356-0-46341";"I told Valsirenn that Clavicus Vile has agreed to get us to the Crystal Tower through his realm. Now I should let her know that Mephala is considering helping us attune the diamond keys."
"103224356-0-46342";"Sotha Sil awaits. I should speak to him and tell him of our success."
"103224356-0-46343";"Ulliceta urged me to meet her outside. I should leave the vault and talk to her."
"103224356-0-46344";"I discovered a strange pedestal atop a bridge deeper in the ruins. Perhaps this is the library pedestal Ulliceta mentioned. I should use the Eye of Remembrance nearby and see if the pedestal reacts."
"103224356-0-46345";"I found another library pedestal inside what may be a gathering hall, or a presentation chamber. I should use the Eye near the pedestal to reveal the next memory."
"103224356-0-46346";"The pull of the Eye has led me to what appears to be a ruined laboratory. I should use the Eye to discover the next memory."
"103224356-0-46347";"I've found what may be the last library pedestal in the ruins. I should use the Eye again. Perhaps I'll finally learn the truth about why the ruins were sealed."
"103224356-0-46348";"An undead creature rose from a tomb in the secret chamber—no doubt left here by Mannimarco and sealed in by the Psijic Order. Now that it has revealed itself, I must destroy it."
"103224356-0-46353";"I've agreed to become Felande's newest tenant. I should speak to her to finalize the deal."
"103224356-0-46354";"Felande has offered me a free room at Saint Delyn's Inn. I should speak to her to learn more about the offer."
"103224356-0-46355";"The last item on Tindoria's list is the rare plant aurialis, located near the sea on a remote hilltop. I should travel there."
"103224356-0-46356";"When I arrived at the location of the aurialis, I encountered a High Elf demanding I speak to him. I should ask him where I can find an aurialis."
"103224356-0-46357";"The hilltop gardener claims there is no aurialis left, but he may be lying. I can search the garden for the plant or press him further and see if he'll tell me more."
"103224356-0-46358";"Turning over a basket revealed a hidden plant. I should examine this plant to see if it matches the description of aurialis in Tindoria's notes."
"103224356-0-46359";"I have found an aurialis, but Ingarlas has begged me not to uproot it. I should speak to him to learn his reasons for asking me not to take the plant."
"103224356-0-46360";"Ingarlas claims this aurialis plant may be the last of its kind, and if I uproot it aurialis could be extinct forever. I can take the plant, as Tindoria requested, or leave it in hopes it will not go extinct."
"103224356-0-46361";"It's time to collect the next ingredient on Tindoria's list, a bug carapace. I can acquire one at Brodran's bug farm, located in southeastern Summerset. I should speak to him."
"103224356-0-46362";"Brodran refuses to give me a bug carapace because he believes Tindoria did something that dramatically lowered the hatchling numbers of his bugs. I should search for signs of sabotage on the farm."
"103224356-0-46363";"When I approached a barrel emitting a suspicious odor, I caught a High Elf pouring something into it. He seems alarmed. I should make him explain himself."
"103224356-0-46364";"The fumes from the barrel I found are suppressing the desire of Brodran's bugs to mate, leading to his problems with egg numbers. The saboteur I found claims Vaerelel put him up to it. I should smash the barrel to end the malaise."
"103224356-0-46365";"Vaerelel, not Tindoria, was responsible for sabotaging Brodran's farm by planting a barrel that created fumes which prevented his bugs from mating. I should inform Brodran of this."
"103224356-0-46366";"The first ingredient on Tindoria's list can be obtained from an alchemist named Haenamil, who lives in a small hut in a remote area of Summerset. I should speak to her."
"103224356-0-46367";"I have visited all locations on Tindoria's list. I should return to Tindoria and deliver the ingredients I've gathered."
"103224356-0-46368";"I met Vaerelel, Tindoria's rival, on the way to speak with her. I should speak to him."
"103224356-0-46369";"Vaerelel has given me a choice. I can sell him Tindoria's art supplies for significantly more than Tindoria would pay me, or remain loyal to my original employer and take the supplies to her. I should tell him my decision."
"103224356-0-46370";"I chose to honor my original contract and deliver the art supplies to Tindoria. I should speak with her."
"103224356-0-46371";"Tindoria is grateful to have the supplies she needs for her painting. I should speak to her about my payment."
"103224356-0-46372";"Vaerelel is pleased I agreed to sell him the supplies instead of Tindoria, and is prepared to pay me extra for what I've gathered. I should speak to him to collect my reward."
"103224356-0-46375";"After defeating Vanus Galerion in the last memory I witnessed, Mannimarco departed for a sealed room. Though something horrible may wait inside, I feel the Eye drawing me on. I must enter the sealed room to learn why these ruins were sealed."
"103224356-0-46379";"I've agreed to become Felande's newest tenant. I should speak to her to finalize the deal."
"103224356-0-46380";"I've agreed to become Felande's newest tenant. I should speak to her to finalize the deal."
"103224356-0-46382";"The Eye revealed what might have been the final confrontation between Mannimarco and Vanus Galerion. I should learn all I can, then continue on."
"103224356-0-46383";"I should travel to Vivec City in Vvardenfell and speak to Felande about the room located within Saint Delyn's Inn."
"103224356-0-46384";"I found the inscribed stone mentioned in the Grand Maestro's Research, but before Leythen could translate it, he was replaced by another member of the Court of Bedlam. I should talk to her."
"103224356-0-46385";"I've decided to take the aurialis for Tindoria's art supplies. I should pull the plant from the ground."
"103224356-0-46387";"Pandermalion informed me that we'll need to follow a whirlpool's current to reach the interior of the ruins beneath Sea Keep. I should follow him through."
"103224356-0-46389";"After entering the dungeon through a secret door known to Pandermalion, we found his lover, Castire, chained up in a cell. I should find out what she knows while Pandermalion unfastens her bonds."
"103224356-0-46390";"We reached the courtyard, but the battlement gates are blocking our path. The mechanisms controlling the gates are in two towers overlooking the courtyard.  Castire will make for one while Pandermalion and I head for the other."
"103224356-0-46397";"We cut Urlsar off from the magic of Sea Keep, but not before he conjured a storm of considerable power. I will have to overcome it and stop him before he unleashes it on the Altmer homeland."
"103224356-0-46399";"The storm dissipated after I defeated Urlsar. With the Sea Mage dead, the threat to Sea Keep is all but gone and the Altmer reinforcements can handle the rest. That only leaves the matter of Castire and Pandermalion's future. I should speak with them"
"103224356-0-46400";"I advised Castire and Pandermalion to abandon the duties keeping them apart. They dove into the sea together, to head for Castire's ship. Pandermalion asked me to report his death to the commander of the arriving reinforcements."
"103224356-0-46401";"Castire and Pandermalion parted ways before the Altmer reinforcements arrived. Their commander will want to know what transpired here, but should I tell her the truth or keep Pandermalion's secret?"
"103224356-0-46402";"I chose to leave Pandermalion's secret out of my report to Battlereeve Farwenya. I should make sure his heroics are noted in the record of what transpired here."
"103224356-0-46403";"I chose to tell Battlereeve Farwenya the truth about the attack on Sea Keep. She awaits my proof that he was the one responsible for the sacking of the keep."
"103224356-0-46406";"I should travel to Vulkhel Guard in Auridon and speak to Felande about the inn room located within Mara's Kiss Public House."
"103224356-0-46407";"I should travel to Daggerfall in Glenumbra and speak to Felande about the inn room located within the Rosy Lion."
"103224356-0-46411";"The Ritemaster headed for the southeast beach to deal with the yaghra incursion. I should meet him in that location."
"103224356-0-46412";"I followed the Ritemaster through the ruins of the College of Psijics and onto the southeastern shore of the island. I should talk to the Ritemaster before we proceed."
"103224356-0-46413";"I need to destroy the abyssal pearl to close the portal that gives the yaghra access to Artaeum."
"103224356-0-46414";"Now that the yaghra portal has been destroyed, I should accompany the Ritemaster to the old vaults to make sure the Psijic relics are secure."
"103224356-0-46415";"I entered the Psijic relic vaults. I should talk to the Ritemaster and determine what he thinks we need to do in here."
"103224356-0-46416";"The Ritemaster suggested that we start our search of the vaults in the central rotunda at the top of the stairs. I should follow him."
"103224356-0-46417";"K'Tora forced the Ritemaster to steal the Heart of Transparent Law from the Crystal Tower, but he doesn't remember where he hid it. I should talk to him and see what I can do to help restore his memory."
"103224356-0-46418";"I should speak with <<1>> about celebrating the New Life Festival."
"103224356-0-46419";"I should speak with <<1>> about celebrating the New Life Festival."
"103224356-0-46420";"I need to return to Ceporah Tower on Artaeum and tell the Ritemaster what Nocturnal's earl revealed about the ancient phrase."
"103224356-0-46422";"Now that the ogre leaders have been defeated, we should head to the temple's entrance in order to rescue Jorvuld's companions."
"103224356-0-46423";"With Soravil defeated, all that remains is to tell Celan's mother what happened to her son. I should go back to town to deliver the bad news."
"103224356-0-46424";"I discovered the body of a young Wood Elf in the fields, not far from the original murder scene. I should blow the whistle Lorne gave me to summon her and Soravil."
"103224356-0-46425";"A few bystanders are lingering nearby. Perhaps I should speak to them. They might be able to provide me with useful information if they witnessed the crime."
"103224356-0-46426";"Lorne asked me to search Halimorion's villa. She suspects that we might find evidence there that could give us insight into the murderer's motive."
"103224356-0-46427";"I found an unsent letter in Halimorion's villa that might implicate the nearby Bosmer in his murder. I should bring this information to Lorne."
"103224356-0-46428";"I could talk to Soravil to get some insight on what exactly we hope to find."
"103224356-0-46430";"Evidence of bad-blood between Halimorion and the nearby Wood Elves keeps piling up. Lorne wants me to investigate the Wood Elf cottage. I'll meet her partner, Soravil, there."
"103224356-0-46431";"It seems like the clan chief's wife might know something. I should speak to her."
"103224356-0-46432";"It sounds like Elsoreth's son might be involved in the murders in one way or another. I should check his room."
"103224356-0-46433";"I should travel to Ebonheart in Stonefalls and speak to Felande about the inn room located within the Ebony Flask."
"103224356-0-46434";"I've agreed to become Felande's newest tenant. I should speak to her to finalize the deal."
"103224356-0-46438";"Felande has offered me a free inn room at the Rosy Lion. I should speak to her to learn more about the offer."
"103224356-0-46439";"Felande has offered me a free inn room at Mara's Kiss Public House. I should speak to her to learn more about the offer."
"103224356-0-46440";"Felande has offered me a free inn room at the Ebony Flask. I should speak to her to learn more about the offer."
"103224356-0-46442";"I found Celan's journal tucked under his bed. It may contain some useful clues. I should examine it."
"103224356-0-46443";"Celan's journal contains a confession that he killed the vintner, Halimorion. It looks like he fled to a nearby shrine to pray for forgiveness. I should tell Soravil about this."
"103224356-0-46444";"Together with Soravil, I need to search the Red Temple for Celan and bring him to justice."
"103224356-0-46445";"Soravil and I split up to cover more ground. I should keep looking for Celan."
"103224356-0-46446";"I found Celan, but the Ghost of the Green shot him with an arrow. He likely won't survive, but perhaps I can get some information from him before he dies."
"103224356-0-46447";"Celan's wound proved fatal. The arrow that killed Celan resembles the one that killed Halimorion. I should take it. It might prove to be a useful clue."
"103224356-0-46448";"I should try to find Soravil before I leave the shrine."
"103224356-0-46449";"I should take the arrow that killed Celan back to Lorne. Perhaps she can use her alchemical prowess to glean something from it."
"103224356-0-46450";"The blood sample was not a match for the bloody weapon found near Farril's body. Lorne believes this new Ghost of the Green killed her, but the trail is growing cold. She believes her friend Tarnamir can help us. I need to follow her to his manor."
"103224356-0-46451";"Someone ransacked the manor before we got here. I should examine the scene."
"103224356-0-46452";"Lorne used a highly restricted spell to witness the last moments of the Ghost's victims' lives. It seems to be troubling her greatly that she resorted to using it. I should speak with her."
"103224356-0-46453";"Lorne's spell revealed that Soravil engineered all the murders in Russafeld. He wants Lorne to confront him in the Red Temple catacombs. I should accompany her there."
"103224356-0-46454";"I need to find Soravil before he escapes. He must be somewhere in the depths of the Red Temple."
"103224356-0-46455";"I found Soravil in the depths of the Red Temple. There's nowhere left for him to run. It's obvious he won't allow himself to be arrested, so I have no choice but to end this by force."
"103224356-0-46456";"Darien's ready. Now I should head into the Dreaming Cave and meet up with the Ritemaster."
"103224356-0-46457";"Darien removed the barrier and opened the way to wherever the Ritemaster hid the Heart of Transparent Law. I should enter the portal and see where it leads."
"103224356-0-46460";"The Ritemaster asked me to check on Darien and make sure he's ready to help us breach the barrier in the Dreaming Cave."
"103224356-0-46462";"We emerged from the Dreaming Cave portal. Now I should talk to the Ritemaster and see if this place triggered any of his missing memories."
"103224356-0-46463";"The Ritemaster was weakened by the effort of opening the portal in the Dreaming Cave. He asked me to scout ahead and clear the path while Valsirenn helps him follow after."
"103224356-0-46466";"Mephala's Daedra stand guard at the entrance to the central rotunda, and some sort of webbed barrier has sealed the door. I need to defeat the Daedra before we can proceed."
"103224356-0-46467";"The barrier of webbing wouldn't burn, but the Golden Knight appeared again and opened the way with his glowing sword before vanishing. I should enter the central rotunda now."
"103224356-0-46468";"Valsirenn has called to me from outside the central rotunda. I should go and talk to her so we can figure out how to help the Ritemaster."
"103224356-0-46469";"Valsirenn sent me in search of one of the relics in the vault, the Ul'vor Staff. She said she can use it to free the Ritemaster from K'Tora's mind magic. I can use the wardkey she provided to open the various repositories as I search."
"103224356-0-46470";"I found the Ul'vor Staff. Now to take it to Valsirenn and see if it can help us free the Ritemaster."
"103224356-0-46471";"Valsirenn has opened a path to the mindscape with the Ul'vor Staff. I need to touch it so I can enter the mindscape and save the Ritemaster."
"103224356-0-46472";"Valsirenn says I need to defeat K'Tora's guardian to reveal the memory it's defending. Only then can I continue to search for the Ritemaster in this alien mindscape."
"103224356-0-46473";"Another guardian and another memory to uncover. I need to defeat the guardian before I can find the Ritemaster."
"103224356-0-46474";"One last memory guardian to vanquish and then I should be able to reach the Ritemaster and K'Tora."
"103224356-0-46475";"I revealed K'Tora's memories and saw how the cabal made a deal with the Daedric Princes, defeated the Ritemaster, altered his memories, and forced him to take the Heart of Transparent Law and hide it. I need to defeat K'Tora and free the Ritemaster."
"103224356-0-46476";"I freed the Ritemaster and defeated K'Tora. I need to use the Ul'vor Staff to exit this mindscape before it completely fades away and I'm trapped inside forever."
"103224356-0-46477";"I emerged from the mindscape to find Sotha Sil standing before me. I should speak to him."
"103224356-0-46478";"I need to leave these vaults and return to Ceporah Tower so I can see how the Ritemaster is faring after his ordeal in the mindscape."
"103224356-0-46479";"I need to return to Ceporah Tower and see how the Ritemaster is faring after his ordeal in the mindscape."
"103224356-0-46480";"The crows seemed to recognize the Ritemaster. I should ask him about that."
"103224356-0-46481";"I should continue to scout ahead and clear the path for the Ritemaster until we find the Heart of Transparent Law."
"103224356-0-46482";"The crows said something about an offer from their mistress. I should ask the Ritemaster if he knows what they were talking about."
"103224356-0-46483";"I need to continue to scout ahead and clear the path up the mountain so we can find the hiding place of the Heart of Transparent Law."
"103224356-0-46484";"We reached the top of the path and it's a dead end. The Ritemaster seems to have remembered something important, though. I should talk to him."
"103224356-0-46485";"The Ritemaster remembered that he took the Heart through this portal and made some sort of deal with Nocturnal to hide it safely. I should use the portal and see where it leads."
"103224356-0-46486";"The Ritemaster said he remembered an ancient ruin. I should head toward that and see what's there."
"103224356-0-46487";"This is the ancient ruin where the Ritemaster remembers casting the spell and hiding away the Heart. I should talk to him before he reveals the hiding place."
"103224356-0-46488";"The Ritemaster said the ancient words, but Clavicus Vile and Mephala appeared. We need to defend ourselves from the Daedric horde."
"103224356-0-46490";"The Ritemaster moved to confront the Sea Sload, K'Tora. I should wait and see what happens."
"103224356-0-46491";"I've just learned about the stolen relics. I should ask Relicmaster Glenadir for more details."
"103224356-0-46492";"The Psijic Codex can tell me the location of the relics. I should read it."
"103224356-0-46493";"I'm unable to take the Psijic Codex with me. I should copy down the locations described in the book."
"103224356-0-46494";"I've copied down the locations of the relics. I should speak to Relicmaster Glenadir once more."
"103224356-0-46495";"I have everything I need to find the relics. I should speak to Relicmaster Glenadir for my reward."
"103224356-0-46496";"Nocturnal appeared, banished the other Princes, and ripped the Heart of Transparent Law from its hiding place inside the Ritemaster's chest. We need to hold on long enough for Valsirenn to finish casting her teleportation spell."
"103224356-0-46497";"Ritemaster Iachesis is dead, the Heart of Transparent Law is in Nocturnal's hands, the triad of Daedric Princes has been dissolved, and Darien lost Meridia's sword, Dawnbreaker. I need to let Oriandra know everything that happened."
"103224356-0-46511";"Sotha Sil has news for the Ritemaster. I should go to his study in Ceporah Tower and try to convince him to share that news with me."
"103224356-0-46512";"Sotha Sil suggested I go to Valsirenn and inform her of his speculations concerning Nocturnal and the Crystal Tower."
"103224356-0-46513";"I reached Valsirenn's study to find her trying to force information out of Leythen. She wants me to talk to him and finish the interrogation."
"103224356-0-46514";"Leythen suggested we make an alliance with Mephala to gain her help against Nocturnal. I should talk to Valsirenn and she what she thinks about that proposal."
"103224356-0-46515";"I need to go to the Crystal Tower Gatehouse, northeast of Lillandril, to meet Valsirenn and Darien. We're going to see how the Sapiarchs are progressing with their attempt to create two new tower sentinels."
"103224356-0-46516";"I need to help defend the ritual platforms against the Daedric attack in order to give the Sapiarchs enough time to complete their ritual to attune the tower sentinels."
"103224356-0-46517";"We defended against the Daedra attacks on the ritual platforms. Now I should check on the new Tower Sentinels and see if they've completed the attunement to the diamond keys."
"103224356-0-46518";"I followed the dog to an isolated location. I suppose I should talk to him now."
"103224356-0-46521";"Clavicus Vile has killed and possessed one of his own cultists. Now he wants to talk to me."
"103224356-0-46522";"Before I try to figure out how to best make use of Clavicus Vile's offer to grant me access to the Crystal Tower, Valsirenn asked me to find Darien and Leythen in the northwest region of Summerset and see what they're up to."
"103224356-0-46523";"Darien says that we need to get the help of the betrayed Daedric Princes and that Leythen has agreed to put us in contact with Mephala. I should talk to Leythen and see what he has planned."
"103224356-0-46524";"We need to enter the headquarters of Mephala's cult and find her shrine. Then Leythen can help us contact his Prince."
"103224356-0-46529";"Seeks-the-Dark needs me to collect several tokens of Meridia from Eton Nir. I should search within the cult's camp. I should also see if I can find his assistant, Erilthel."
"103224356-0-46533";"I've recovered the tokens and saved Erilthel. I should let Seeks-the-Dark know."
"103224356-0-46534";"I found an ancient Aldmer altar room, but no sign of Teraniel or a portal. I should speak to Lindafwe and see if she knows what we should be looking for."
"103224356-0-46535";"Lindafwe believes the altar is being used as an anchor to the Gorge, but we need to undo Teraniel's anchor spell before we can create an opening of our own. The books in this chamber should reveal how we can accomplish that."
"103224356-0-46536";"I successfully undid Teraniel's spell and Lindafwe is creating an achor of her own."
"103224356-0-46537";"Razum-dar ran into the nearby watchtower. I should follow him and find out what he's doing here."
"103224356-0-46538";"Valsirenn appears to be helping the Sapiarchs with their ritual. I should talk to her and see if she has any information about what's happening here."
"103224356-0-46543";"The Sapiarchs trying to attune themselves to the diamond keys so they could open the way to the Crystal Tower are dead. I should talk to Valsirenn and find out what our next option is."
"103224356-0-46544";"I found the remains of a Keeper and the Crimson Seal. I should take it back to the main foyer of the catacombs."
"103224356-0-46545";"The inscription on the tablet referenced the ""Eyes of the Keepers"" looking upon something below. A recess in a nearby pillar looks like a perfect fit for the seal. I should slot it in and see what happens."
"103224356-0-46548";"I should search the lower catacombs for whatever is tormenting Lauriel's spirit."
"103224356-0-46549";"I found Lauriel's physical remains. They've been preserved and bound here for some reason. I should ask Lauriel's ghost about this."
"103224356-0-46550";"Lauriel wants me to free her spirit by burning her remains. Conversely, I could light the Sanctified Brazier and bind her spirit back to her corpse, preventing her escape. I must take up the Keeper's flame and choose."
"103224356-0-46551";"With the Keeper's Flame in hand, I must choose whether to burn Lauriel's remains and free her spirit, or light the sanctified brazier to bind her once more."
"103224356-0-46552";"I elected to light the Sanctified Brazier, thus binding Lauriel's spirit to her tomb once again. I should return to Erator and tell him about all that's transpired."
"103224356-0-46553";"I need to meet Razum-dar in Alinor so we can warn the Proxy Queen about Nocturnal's assault on the Crystal Tower."
"103224356-0-46556";"Razum-dar said I should go to the gardens in Alinor to look for a strange talking dog that has a message for me."
"103224356-0-46557";"Mehdze's scribe, Naliara, was kidnapped by Goblins and is in need of rescue. He told me they took her into the nearby caves. I should search for her there."
"103224356-0-46558";"Naliara told me she pursued the Goblins here to recover notes stolen from Mehdze's camp. She's requested my help searching for them scattered throughout the caves of King's Haven Pass."
"103224356-0-46559";"I recovered Naliara's lost notes. I should return them to her near the eastern exit from the Coral-Splitter Caves in King's Haven Pass."
"103224356-0-46560";"Naliara requested one last favor from me. She asked me to bring the research notes I collected to Mehdze, and inform him she won't be continuing their partnership."
"103224356-0-46561";"I delivered Mehdze his lost notes, and he has asked me to help him in Naliara's stead. He's searching for an ancient battle site hidden in the caves of King's Haven Pass. I should find the entrance ""where two falls meet stone."""
"103224356-0-46562";"I found the hidden ruins. I should help Mehdze search for objects of interest to his research on the war between the Goblins and High Elves."
"103224356-0-46563";"I convinced Mehdze to tell the truth and share it with the world. I should talk to him one more time and make sure he's still good with that decision."
"103224356-0-46564";"I examined the ruins with Mehdze and discovered some records that implies more happened here than just a war. I should speak with Mehdze to see if he found what he came for."
"103224356-0-46566";"I've been requested to find the hulkynd who is currently in the wilderness outside Rellenthil. I should head there to begin my search."
"103224356-0-46567";"The hulkynd that Tableau wishes to meet has addressed me. I should speak to him."

"103224356-0-46575";"Manacar and I confronted the Blackbirds, only to have Tableau jump up and apologize as the Blackbirds ran off. I should speak with her and see what's going on."
"103224356-0-46576";"I convinced Tableau that Manacar wants her to succeed as an artist, and thus he cannot be her friend."
"103224356-0-46577";"I convinced Manacar that Tableau has a right to choose what makes her happiest, regardless of what Manacar thinks is best."
"103224356-0-46578";"Tableau used her former troupe members to fake her kidnapping so that she could reconnect with Manacar. I should speak with them and resolve this dispute."
"103224356-0-46579";"Courtier Vindilween finally agreed to allow Rigurt to meet with the Proxy Queen. I should let Rigurt know so he can prepare for the meeting."

"103224356-0-46581";"I need to get Rigurt a recommendation from Sapiarch Tandemen, a writ of authenticity from Justiciar Rolumdel, and tickets from Enigma to her next performance. Vindilween suggests I use the currency of favors to accomplish these tasks."

"103224356-0-46597";"Courtier Vindilween gave Rigurt an appointment with the Proxy Queen, but it's a long way off. I should talk to him and see what he wants to do now."
"103224356-0-46598";"I suggested that we use the information Justiciar Rolumdel provided to convince Vindilween to get Rigurt an immediate audience with the Proxy Queen. Rigurt agreed but suggested the threat would be better coming from me."

"103224356-0-46601";"Elise did not stick around to help with our search, but mentioned that she saw Lotus by the reflecting pool. We should continue our search there."
"103224356-0-46602";"We spotted Lotus at the reflecting pool, like Elise said, but she got spooked and fled from us. Talomar took off in pursuit of her. I should follow them."
"103224356-0-46604";"Arathel's map led me to a scroll tucked away in a hedge maze. I should read this scroll and see what it says."
"103224356-0-46605";"The note I found urged Arathel to meet a mysterious figure in the Anchors Aweigh Inn in Shimmerene. I can either follow the note's instructions or report what I found to the Justiciar of Remand, Talerion."

"103224356-0-46608";"The hooded man, Edgar, urged me to find his mistress, the Mother of Rats. She might know more about Arathel's disappearance. I'll need to find the entrance to Shimmerene's underground if I'm going to meet her. It should be near the docks."
"103224356-0-46609";"I chose to return to Talerion. I should show him the scroll I found."
"103224356-0-46610";"Talerion agreed to let me follow the path Arathel took out of his cell into the underground. I must delve into the sewers to find a mysterious figure—the Mother of Rats."

"103224356-0-46632";"The portal master has activated the portal dais to transport me to the College of Sapiarchs. I should use the portal dais to reach the college compound."
"103224356-0-46634";"I convinced Mehdze to hide the truth regarding the Elven ruin. I should talk to him one more time and make sure he's still good with that decision."
"103224356-0-46641";"Lotus was caught by some other menagerie staff. Their leader, Conservator Vinelore, wants to have words with me."
"103224356-0-46642";"Valsirenn cast a spell of binding on a Daedric cultist and seems to have the situation well in hand. I should speak to Sapiarch Larnatille and tell her what happened to the Heart of Transparent Law."
"103224356-0-46643";"I should speak to Valsirenn and the captive cultist before I go look for the tower sentinels."
"103224356-0-46644";"While Valsirenn takes the imprisoned Leythen, formerly of the Psijic Order and now an earl in the Court of Bedlam, to Artaeum, I need to travel to the Illumination Academy and locate the two tower sentinels, Hannayel and Imedril."
"103224356-0-46645";"I need to find the tower sentinels somewhere here in the Illumination Academy. Raz suggested that we start our search in the Academy Guest Wing on the western side of the campus."
"103224356-0-46646";"I solved the book puzzle and it revealed Sapiarch Hannayel's hiding place. I should talk to her to make sure she's all right and to find out where Sapiarch Imedril can be found."
"103224356-0-46647";"Hannayel said that I can find Sapiarch Imedril in King's Haven Pass, studying the old ruins at that location. I should go there and find the second tower sentinel."

"103224356-0-46649";"I found Sapiarch Imedril, but he's in trouble. Something is pulling him toward that gaping portal. The Golden Knight is trying to help him. I should lend a hand."
"103224356-0-46650";"I should see how the tower sentinel is doing."
"103224356-0-46651";"Something reached out of the portal and whisked the Golden Knight away. A gem was knocked out of the hilt of his sword. Before he disappeared, the Golden Knight asked me to retrieve it."
"103224356-0-46652";"Valsirenn appeared and asked me to return to Artaeum. Apparently, the Ritemaster has need of me. I should go to Artaeum as soon as I can."
"103224356-0-46653";"Now that I returned to Artaeum, I should head to Ceporah Tower and talk to the Ritemaster. I need to tell him what I learned and find out why he had Valsirenn summon me."
"103224356-0-46659";"Now that we're in the Sapiarchs' Labyrinth, I should confer with Valsirenn about our next move."
"103224356-0-46660";"Conservator Vinelore said she would handle Lotus and commanded Talomar and I to leave the menagerie grounds. I should speak to Talomar about this."

"103224356-0-46669";"Nocturnal's earl has given us a cryptic warning. I should talk to Leythen and see if he knows what she's talking about."
"103224356-0-46670";"Leythen left us and went with Nocturnal's earl deeper into the ruins. We have to follow them."
"103224356-0-46671";"Leythen thinks he can contact Mephala if we go to his private chamber. I should follow him there."
"103224356-0-46672";"Nocturnal plans to siphon the life energy of Nirn to increase the power of the Crystal Tower. And with that power, she plans to remake all of reality. I should talk to Leythen and see if he's willing to contact Mephala now."
"103224356-0-46673";"Leythen said I should meet him outside so we can make contact with Mephala."
"103224356-0-46674";"Mephala has answered Leythen's summons. I should talk to the Daedric Prince."
"103224356-0-46675";"I made deals with both of the betrayed Princes. I should return to Artaeum and talk to Valsirenn. She needs to hear what happened, and I should see if the Psijics have figured out how to use the diamond keys yet."
"103224356-0-46678";"Elise confessed to drugging the animals, but claims she did so only for an opportunity to collect evidence of mistreatment of the animals. She's asked us to help her. I should speak to Talomar about this."
"103224356-0-46683";"The inside of the Conservatory contains all manner of alchemical equipment. I should search for some proof of wrongdoing going on here."
"103224356-0-46684";"Razum-dar? I wonder what he's doing at the Illumination Academy? I should talk to him and find out."
"103224356-0-46690";"I found a key to the Conservatory on the body of one of Vinelore's rangers. I should use it to gain us access to the inside."

"103224356-0-46697";"Conservator Vinelore and one of her test subjects have blocked my path through the inner paddocks. I will have to fight my way past to reach Lotus."
"103224356-0-46699";"Oriandra wants me to exit the ruin so she can show me something."
"103224356-0-46700";"I followed Oriandra out of the ruin, but instead of Summerset, I stepped into a bizarre, alien landscape. I need to find her so she can explain where I am."
"103224356-0-46701";"Oriandra suggests I look around and try to get my bearings."
"103224356-0-46703";"Oriandra says I can move. She wants me to walk toward her."
"103224356-0-46706";"We reached the Academy Guest Wing. Now I should search Sapiarch Hannayel's room."
"103224356-0-46709";"Raz thinks that Hannayel hid a coded message in her letter to Imedril. He thinks the key to finding her hidden quiet room involves four specific books and reading podiums."
"103224356-0-46717";"Fletch has explained that Andewen was trapped by the Spirit of the Sanctum, but that I can stop it from ever happening. I should convince Andewen to leave Ebon Stadmont, before she is trapped."

"103224356-0-46721";"Sotha Sil has asked to speak with me. I should go to his study in Ceporah Tower and talk to him."
"103224356-0-46726";"Justiciar Avanaire is dead. I should find and destroy the pearl."
"103224356-0-46730";"The Saviors are truly dead and their captives released, but the cave dwellers still remain in buried Corgrad. I should speak to Faidur about what he learned about his family's past and his own future."
"103224356-0-46731";"Ruliel, one of the outcasts, suggested I talk to the agitated Altmer who's been harassing his group. The High Elf claims to be the heir to the estate and has been pressuring the outcasts to leave his land."
"103224356-0-46732";"<<1>> is somewhere within Archon's Grove. If she's alive I need to safely return her to Shimmerene. If she's dead, I need to collect proof of her death. I should search the grove for signs of her."
"103224356-0-46733";"I found <<1>>, bloodied but alive in the back of the grove. I should talk with her and see what happened."
"103224356-0-46734";"Niralin was forcibly turned into a werewolf and requested I kill her to end her suffering. I agreed, and afterwards took her signet ring as proof of our meeting. I should return to Shimmerene."
"103224356-0-46735";"I helped destroy the pearl and prevented Justiciar Avanaire from abusing its power. I should speak to Captain Telomure."
"103224356-0-46748";"Vanus arranged an enchanted boat to take me to where Marieve was last seen. I should find that boat near the docks."

"103224356-0-46756";"Much of Congrad appears to have sunken into the sea, but some of the buildings still poke above the surface. Faidur and I need to find a way inside."
"103224356-0-46759";"K'Tora, the entity that has imprisoned me in this mind trap, has turned my own memories against me. I need to defend myself and defeat the mental enemies."

"103224356-0-46761";"I need to remember how to interrupt my enemy's attack and follow it up with a heavy attack of my own."

"103224356-0-46768";"Oriandra can't accompany me any farther in her projected form, but she may be able to send messages to guide me. It's up to me to free myself from this place. When I'm ready, I should jump to the area below."
"103224356-0-46769";"Oriandra explained that the way to escape this mind trap is through the tower in the distance. I just need to reach it."
"103224356-0-46770";"Oriandra says that the key to escaping this mind trap is the strange pearl up ahead. I should examine it."
"103224356-0-46771";"The mysterious entity, K'Tora, wants to keep me imprisoned. It summoned some sort of nightmare to restrain me. I need to defeat it before I can make my escape."
"103224356-0-46772";"I defeated the summoned nightmare and the strange pearl reappeared. Oriandra says that if I destroy it, I'll wake up and escape this mind trap."

"103224356-0-46785";"Wasten Coraldale has been invaded by hostile Sea Elf raiders, but I found Curtaros asleep and unharmed. After I informed him of the danger he asked me to find the other members of his angler fleet while he keeps an eye on the invaders."
"103224356-0-46786";"I located the other anglers, but one of them didn't survive the sudden Sea Elf occupation. I should meet up with Curtaros and the survivors."
"103224356-0-46787";"Curtaros told me that the Sea Elves have already begun to entrench themselves on Wasten Coraldale and will pose a significant threat to Summerset and its navy if they're allowed to establish a foothold. I agreed to help him disrupt their efforts."
"103224356-0-46789";"Curtaros and I heavily damaged a Sea Elf ship and caused enough chaos to make a successful escape from Wasten Coraldale. I should speak to Hiranesse now that I have returned her father safely home."
"103224356-0-46793";"The documents we found imply that there are burial vaults beneath the manor where the family took shelter as the plague worsened. I should speak to Faidur about our next move."
"103224356-0-46794";"A crumbling wall has exposed a tunnel of eroded stone leading deeper under the estate. Faidur thought he heard movement coming from the passage, which might be a sign of the missing persons. We should continue our search."
"103224356-0-46795";"We stumbled across an encampment of people huddled around a fire in the cavern. They seem almost primitive, definitely not Ruliel's friends. One of the group invited us to join them."
"103224356-0-46807";"Sotha Sil said to meet him in the Dreaming Cave."
"103224356-0-46811";"Arillas told me he saw strangers from the surface head deeper into buried Corgrad, through a narrow tunnel to the north. Faidur has decided to remain with Arillas to learn more about this place. I will continue to search for the missing persons."

"103224356-0-46830";"I should take the Altmer Cultural Guide to <<1>>. The chapter on dueling customs will probably be helpful."
"103224356-0-46831";"Apparently, High Elf dueling customs require the duelists to use traditional Altmer dueling foils. I'll need to purchase or steal one from a person in Alinor."
"103224356-0-46832";"I should travel to Lirendel's family shrine and learn his full name. I will need to recite it before the duel can commence."
"103224356-0-46833";"I collected the dueling foil and learned Lirendel's full name. Now all I need to do is issue the challenge to Lirendel's second, <<1>>."
"103224356-0-46834";"Lirendel refused to explain the High Elf dueling customs, but directed me to a book that might help. I should collect it."
"103224356-0-46835";"Mephala forged the two Resolute Diamonds into a single gem that serves as both an anchor and a key. I should wait while the portal to Clavicus Vile's realm opens."
"103224356-0-46836";"I should follow Barbas to Clavicus Vile's realm so he can show us the way to the Crystal Tower."
"103224356-0-46837";"Despite our agreement with Clavicus Vile, it looks like we're going to have to fight our way to the Crystal Tower."
"103224356-0-46843";"The narrow passage lead to a dead end. There are bodies here that may be those of the missing squatters. I should search them for anything that would identify who they are."
"103224356-0-46845";"The letter was a warning from Karnhar about the cave people, who ambushed me shortly after I discovered the truth. I need to find Faidur and get him out of here before he comes to harm."
"103224356-0-46849";"The cave people appear to have taken Faidur. Following the sound of his cries led me into the vaults beneath the Corgrad estate. I should search the chambers for him."
"103224356-0-46850";"I found Arillas's keys in some sort of alchemical laboratory. I should be able to use them to free the prisoners from their bonds and open the door leading to Faidur and the Saviors."
"103224356-0-46856";"I found Faidur inside the Saviors' crypt being subjected to some sort of ritual. Though their bodies are nothing more than desiccated husks, the Saviors appear aware. At least one of them has bid me to speak to him."
"103224356-0-46857";"Crazed by the death of his Saviors, Arillas attempted to stop our escape, but I was able to best him in combat. We should be close to the surface now. We just need to reach it."
"103224356-0-46859";"I found several missing persons being held captive in the estate's vaults. The appear to have been tortured. I should speak to them and find out what's going on."
"103224356-0-46862";"I managed to lead Faidur and the others to the surface safely. Ruliel will want to hear about what has transpired down in those ruins and the fates of those who didn't escape."
"103224356-0-46869";"Barbas wants to talk to me. I should see what he has to say."
"103224356-0-46870";"The Resolute Anchor serves as both a key to the Crystal Tower and an anchor to our reality. Since I have it, we should be able to enter the Crystal Tower."
"103224356-0-46871";"We need to reach the top of the Crystal Tower to confront Nocturnal."
"103224356-0-46874";"A Sapiarch, and she's still alive. I should talk to her."
"103224356-0-46875";"The dying Sapiarch mentioned a broken ballista. If I can find it and repair it, I might be able to use it to clear the debris that's blocking the path up the tower."
"103224356-0-46876";"Razum-dar asked me to talk to a few people from Shimmerene to gauge reactions to the Queen's decree to open Summerset to newcomers. He suggested I speak with Olnewil, Rhanul, and Tsoxolza."
"103224356-0-46883";"I finished interviewing the people Razum-dar suggested. I should find him near the entrance to Shimmerene and let him know what I found out."
"103224356-0-46884";"I found and captured a spider in the Academy courtyard. I should release it near Selynia to scare her. Hopefully this will break the Illuminus's enchantment."
"103224356-0-46885";"Scaring Selynia seems to have worked! I should talk to her and send her back to Erudil."
"103224356-0-46893";"The ballista isn't broken, it just needs to be reassembled. I should locate the missing pieces so Darien can put it back together."
"103224356-0-46894";"I should urge Pavo to return to Erudil in the central courtyard."
"103224356-0-46899";"I should urge Tanelwen to meet up with Erduil in the central courtyard."
"103224356-0-46911";"Glardir took the Illuminus and fled toward the Hall of Illumination! I need to track her down."
"103224356-0-46914";"The ballista is ready. I should be able to use it to open the way forward now."
"103224356-0-46915";"We need to ascend the tower to confront Nocturnal."
"103224356-0-46916";"This appears to be the tower's library. We need to find a way to move forward."

"103224356-0-47154";"I should ask Faidur about our shadowy figure and see if he has any insight as to who could be stalking these tunnels."

"103224356-0-47390";"I promised Talomar that I would find Lotus and bring her to safety. She's being held somewhere in the inner paddocks, but with the indriks and Vinelore on the loose mounting a rescue will be dangerous."

"103224356-0-47433";"Faidur asked me to help him search the manor for anything that might tell us about the history of the place. I am not sure there will be much left untouched by the elements, but I will keep an eye out regardless."
"103224356-0-47437";"Calawende suggested I search Galidor's ledger to find out what dealings he had with Emile. The ledger is magically warded, but I can make it readable by learning and reciting a passphrase. Perhaps I'll find some clues in Galidor's room."
"103224356-0-47438";"Oriandra suggested that Leythen could help translate the ancient words, since he was the Psijic Order's language expert before he left to join the Court of Bedlam. I should talk to Leythen in Valsirenn's study."
"103224356-0-47439";"There is a badly weathered statue in the foyer that appears to be of the head of the household. Faidur will want to hear about this."
"103224356-0-47440";"Faidur was intrigued by the possibility that his family has ties to nobility, but it only makes the mystery of their disappearance from history all the more strange. Faidur wants to continue searching for clues."
"103224356-0-47441";"I found a journal belonging to one of Faidur's ancestors. I should show it to him."
"103224356-0-47442";"I've completed the tasks Kinlady Helenaere asked of me. I should meet with her and Khavid in Sunhold's merchant district."
"103224356-0-47443";"Faidur believes the journal I found comes from the time of the Thrassian Plague, possibly explaining why the town disappeared. He suggested we continue our search of the remaining upstairs rooms for more clues."
"103224356-0-47446";"I freed the captive squatters. The one named Henrigg wishes to speak to me."
"103224356-0-47448";"Now that I have found the Saviors, I could take this opportunity to learn more about them."
"103224356-0-47449";"Destroying the stone freed Faidur from its influence and appeared to kill the Saviors. I should see if Faidur is all right."
"103224356-0-47471";"The first adventurer Oriandra asked me to set free is a mage called Cainar. She thinks he can help us rescue the others once he's released from his mind trap."
"103224356-0-47472";"Cainar wants samples of the spell particles for his research. I need to find some for him before he will agree to leave. They should be nearby."
"103224356-0-47473";"I have the spell particles Cainar asked for. I should bring them to him."
"103224356-0-47475";"It appears that Grog resisted the mind trap on his own, but he's still unconscious. I need to find a way to wake him up. I should look around for something that will help in that regard."
"103224356-0-47477";"I found a bucket of water. That should do the trick. I just need to toss it on Grog to wake him up."
"103224356-0-47478";"Now I need to find the adventurer named Miriya. She must be somewhere deeper in the ruins."
"103224356-0-47479";"I found Miriya, but the mind trap that has her in its grip has progressed to an almost inescapable point. Oriandra says that her sense of self is breaking apart. I need to find a way to help her."
"103224356-0-47480";"Oriandra thinks that the items she's leaving behind might be the key to helping her remember herself. I should see if there are any other items I need to collect as I follow her path."
"103224356-0-47481";"I collected a number of items that seem to be important to Miriya. I should give them to her and try to convince her to wake up now."
"103224356-0-47483";"After Oriandra pulled us out of Miriya's mindscape, something happened. I need to return to Oriandra and make sure everything is all right."
"103224356-0-47484";"K'Tora left a trap that attacked Oriandra's mind. Cainar reestablished the mind link so I can enter the mind trap and rescue her. I need to hurry."
"103224356-0-47485";"Next I need to search for an Orc warrior called Grog. He should be in the ruins somewhere nearby."
"103224356-0-47486";"Leythen has reestablished his connection to the rune. I should talk to him."
"103224356-0-47487";"Nubani revealed that Renzir's a smuggler, and she worries he's addicted to the lifestyle and will never settle down. She asked me to dump Renzir's goods in order to force him to retire, which I agreed to do so. I should dump the goods."
"103224356-0-47490";"I delivered Roguzog's challenge to Lirendel's second. The duel will commence soon. I should go talk to <<1>> and make sure he's prepared."

"103224356-0-47492";"Lirendel has finally accepted Roguzog's challenge. Time to find out how this duel will pan out."
"103224356-0-47493";"Ulliceta said there are library pedestals in this ruin which may react to the Eye of Remembrance, revealing the secrets of why this vault was sealed away. I should search for the first library pedestal and defeat any undead in my way."
"103224356-0-47494";"When I used the Eye of Remembrance near the pedestal, I witnessed a memory of Vanus Galerion and Mannimarco. I can feel the eye drawing me deeper in the ruins. There must be more pedestals to find. I should keep looking."
"103224356-0-47495";"The Eye of Remembrance draws me deeper in the ruin. The next library pedestal is close. I must find it."
"103224356-0-47496";"The pull of the Eye is stronger than ever. It feels like it is consciously directing me now, to what may be the memory that finally reveals why this library was sealed. I should see if I can find the fourth library pedestal."
"103224356-0-47498";"I found Talomar being held at arrowpoint by Conservator Vinelore. I should confront her about what we discovered about the experiments."
"103224356-0-47507";"Vinafwe suspects a Wood Elf named Eslion is responsible for her problems and requested that I search her defaced arrangements for evidence tying him to the crimes."
"103224356-0-47508";"I discovered a long abandoned gardening tool that has seen recent use, but I will need more than that to prove Eslion is responsible. I need to search some of Vinafwe's other arrangements."
"103224356-0-47509";"I found an animal hide bag still containing seeds not native to Summerset. It's a good step toward identifying Eslion as the vandal, but I should search the remaining arrangement as well."
"103224356-0-47510";"Stranglers erupted from the ground while I was searching one of Vinafwe's plots. They are too dangerous to leave behind. I should kill them off."
"103224356-0-47511";"A Wood Elf called out to me after I dealt with the stranglers in Vinafwe's arrangement. I should see what he has to say."
"103224356-0-47512";"I found Eslion, who admits he's been planting foreign plants in Vinafwe's arrangements, but claims the stranglers are an accident. He asked me to help poison them to correct his mistake and provided me with a mixture to pour into local water sources."
"103224356-0-47513";"I added the poison Eslion concocted to the local water sources, which should end the strangler threat. Now I should inform Vinafwe about what I discovered."
"103224356-0-47514";"It appears Eslion's apologies fell on deaf ears, as I found him in the custody of the Divine Prosecution at Vinafwe's home. I should talk to him about his predicament."
"103224356-0-47515";"Eslion believes he's going to be arrested and thrown in jail for his actions and has begged me to speak to the Divine Prosecution on his behalf. I need to decide what to tell them."
"103224356-0-47516";"Regardless of Eslion's intentions, what he did was illegal and harmful. He has to face the consequences for what he did. I need to tell <<1>> that Eslion is guilty."
"103224356-0-47517";"Despite his culpability, I decided that Eslion's attempt to fix his mistake deserves leniency. I should ask <<1>> to consider that when rendering his judgment."
"103224356-0-47518";"Before I decide what to tell the Divine Prosecution about what happened here, I may want to consider Vinafwe's stance on the issue."
"103224356-0-47527";"I found Lotus cowering in a cage not far from where I fought Vinelore. I should use the ward breaker Elise gave me to free her."
"103224356-0-47530";"While Valsirenn attempts to reach the Sea Sload, I need to destroy the abyssal pearls before they attract more of those yaghra creatures."
"103224356-0-47531";"Andewen's note told me to follow her. I should activate the stone in order to do so."
"103224356-0-47532";"I've activated the stone in order to open the doorway. A mysterious voice spoke to me about the past. I should enter the doorway to seek out Andewen."
"103224356-0-47533";"Fletch has arrived in the clearing, and has struck Andewen with an arrow. I should listen to what he has to say."
"103224356-0-47534";"Andewen has been gravely wounded by Fletch. I should speak to her."
"103224356-0-47536";"I've found Andewen being attacked by a Daedra. I should protect her by defeating the Daedra."
"103224356-0-47537";"Andewen found a High Elf severely wounded. I should help bandage his wounds while Andewen heals him."
"103224356-0-47538";"I escaped from the mind trap. I should speak to Oriandra now."
"103224356-0-47539";"I should speak to Felarian to learn what I must first do to create a ring."
"103224356-0-47540";"<<1>> is already familiar with my skill in crafting jewelry. I should speak with him to become certified. Once certified, I will be able to fulfill jewelry crafting writs."
"103224356-0-47541";"Felarian wants me to return with pewter dust. I should search the outskirts of the city for pewter seams to harvest."
"103224356-0-47542";"Felarian asked me to return with pewter ounces. I can refine pewter dust into pewter ounces at a jewelry crafting station. Alternatively, I could ask a friend for help or purchase some from a guild store."

"103224356-0-47547";"I need to deconstruct the ring I made for Felarian. I can do so at a jewelry crafting station.\n\nFelarian said I could deconstruct something else if I wanted to keep the ring."
"103224356-0-47548";"Felarian is satisfied with my skill as a jewelry crafter. I should speak with him to become certified. Once certified, I will be able to fulfill jewelry crafting writs."
"103224356-0-47549";"I found a lab report that confirms dangerous experiments are being conducted on the indriks here. Elise will want to see what I found."
"103224356-0-47556";"It appears that Glardir has taken refuge in the Academy Stacks. I must pursue her."
"103224356-0-47557";"The Stacks are in a state of magical chaos. Perhaps the archivist can help shed some light on the situation."
"103224356-0-47558";"The archivist was clearly affected by the enchantment, but he still managed to give me good advice. I must dispel the Illuminus's hostile illusions by closing the book they sprung from and filing it away in the stacks."
"103224356-0-47559";"I dispelled the forest illusions. I should delve deeper into the archives and dispel any other illusions I find."
"103224356-0-47561";"I managed to dispel the Imperial illusions. I should delve deeper into the archives and banish any other illusions I find."
"103224356-0-47562";"I should look for the source of these hostile illusions—an enchanted book."
"103224356-0-47563";"I found the ensorceled book. I should file it away on the correct bookshelf to dispel the illusions."

"103224356-0-47579";"Now that I have the Psijic Map of Summerset and the Psijic Seals, I need to track down the final item—the Augur of the Obscure. According to Josajeh, I'll find it somewhere along the coast of Wasten Coraldale."
"103224356-0-47580";"I discovered the talkative Augur of the Obscure hidden in a chest. I should talk to it."
"103224356-0-47581";"I should reclaim the Augur. It seems to have an odd and unpredictable personality, but it promised to help me track down these time breaches."
"103224356-0-47584";"I must go speak with Loremaster Celarus's apprentice, Josajeh, in the Athenaeum. She should be able to direct me to the objects I need to complete my task."

"103224356-0-47631";"While Adonatus frees his fellow prisoners, I must keep the guards distracted. I should start making my way through the prison."
"103224356-0-47632";"The head guard of the prison, Jailer Melitus, blocks my way into the keep. I should defeat him."

"103224356-0-47645";"With the spriggan defeated, I can continue the Great Hunt with Hanu. I should explore the Wispwood and see if I can pick up the indrik's trail."

"103224356-0-47745";"Talomar and I found signs that the animals might have been exposed to tainted feed, which could explain their aggression. We haven't found any sign of Lotus, however, and should continue our search."
"103224356-0-47750";"I should talk to Josajeh. She can give me the equipment I need, and she probably has a lot to say about our current situation."
"103224356-0-47751";"I must explore the land of Craglorn and seal any time breaches I find."
"103224356-0-47752";"As soon as I sealed the final time breach in Craglorn, Loremaster Celarus appeared. He urged me to return to Artaeum at once. I should hurry back and find out what's happened."

"103224356-0-47761";"I should travel to the four locations Loremaster Celarus mentioned and find the Staff fragments hidden there."

"103224356-0-47770";"Sotha Sil wants me to speak to him when I'm ready to start the assault on the Crystal Tower."
"103224356-0-47779";"Pandermalion told me that there are several Magicka Fonts that channel power to the battlements from the Aldmer ruins below. If we seal those fonts, we may cut the Sea Mage off from his main source of power."
"103224356-0-47783";"We have unbarred the gate to the battlements, leaving nothing standing between us and Urlsar, the Sea Mage. I need to reach the battlements and put a stop to his storm."
"103224356-0-47785";"Castire confirmed that the Maormer are planning to destroy Sea Keep and that their Sea Mage is on the battlements gathering a storm with the power to do so. Pandermalion seems to have an idea of how we might thwart their plans."
"103224356-0-47790";"I should equip the weapon so that I'm ready for anything."
"103224356-0-47792";"This artifact vault is surprisingly free of Nocturnal's shadow creatures. But I also don't see a way to continue our journey to the top of the tower. I need to find an exit."
"103224356-0-47793";"I should talk to Loremaster Celarus. He might be able to share some more useful information."
"103224356-0-47794";"I should travel to the four locations Loremaster Celarus mentioned and find the staff fragments hidden there."
"103224356-0-47795";"I collected all four staff fragments. I should return to Artaeum and deliver them to Loremaster Celarus."

"103224356-0-47816";"Henrigg told me Faidur is trapped in the crypts with the Saviors. I need to find him and rescue him before it is too late."
"103224356-0-47819";"According to Loremaster Celarus, his apprentice probably went to a mine called Divad's Chagrin. I should travel to this mine to look for Josajeh."
"103224356-0-47821";"I found a gaping time breach that Josajeh likely used as a portal. I should follow her through it to see where (or when) it leads."
"103224356-0-47822";"I found Josajeh in a bizarre alternative version of the Imperial Throne room! I must stop her ritual before it spins completely out of control."
"103224356-0-47823";"I turned back the tide of converging time-lines and freed Josajeh from the staff's violent influence. Now that the threat has passed, I should talk to her."
"103224356-0-47824";"Now that I've settled my business with the Augur, I should return to Loremaster Celarus."
"103224356-0-47825";"I chose to free the Augur. I should deliver the oddity to Josajeh."
"103224356-0-47826";"The Augur of the Obscure's fate rests in my hands. I must choose whether to return it to the Psijic Vault, or give it to Josajeh for safekeeping."
"103224356-0-47827";"I chose to return the Augur to the Psijic Vault. I should make my way there and place the Augur where it belongs."
"103224356-0-47828";"Josajeh agreed to take the Augur. I should inform the Psijic Relicmaster of my choice."
"103224356-0-47829";"I should talk to Loremaster Celarus to receive my final reward."
"103224356-0-47830";"I returned the Augur to the vault. Now, I should catch up with Josajeh before she leaves the island."
"103224356-0-47832";"Arillas is livid about me killing his Saviors. He's blocked off our escape route. We'll have to go through him to make our escape from the ruins of Corgrad."
"103224356-0-47834";"Castire seems unsettled by our confrontation with one of her former crew members. I should find out what's bothering her."
"103224356-0-47835";"We found the body of one of Pandermalion's comrades in one of the gate towers. He seems shaken up by the discovery. I should speak to him."
"103224356-0-47837";"Josajeh transcribed a map of Summerset that details the approximate locations of the time breaches I need to seal. I should take it."
"103224356-0-47841";"Josajeh agreed to respect the Psijics' decision for her future. I should return to Artaeum to see how this plays out."
"103224356-0-47844";"I spoke to the heir to the lands Ruliel's people are squatting on, Faidur, and he denies any knowledge of the disappearances. He claims he only recently arrived to explore his lost family holdings. We agreed to search the ruins together."
"103224356-0-47845";"I should talk to Loremaster Celarus to receive my final reward."
"103224356-0-47846";"I informed the Relicmaster that the Augur was leaving. Now, I should catch up with Josajeh before she leaves the island."
"103224356-0-47857";"Talomar seemed to know the keeper I rescued, Elise. He can probably tell me more about her."
"103224356-0-47859";"I discovered the talkative Augur of the Obscure hidden in a chest. I should talk to it."
"103224356-0-47863";"I agreed to work with Alchemy to absorb the spell cast by Rinyde, revealing my identity but protecting the others. I should listen to my cue to start my audition."
"103224356-0-47864";"I decided to let Rinyde cast her spell and reveal the performers auditioning for the House of Reveries. I should watch the audition."
"103224356-0-47865";"I decided to let Rinyde cast her spell and reveal the performers auditioning for the House of Reveries. I should wait for Grand Maestro Forte to start the audition."
"103224356-0-47866";"I should take a look at the map Josajeh transcribed. Familiarizing myself with it might help later."
"103224356-0-47882";"Faidur and I were able to enter a buried manor through a broken window. The place is in total ruin and there's no sign of the missing people yet. I should confer with Faidur about what we're looking for here."
"103224356-0-47885";"I should travel to Russafeld and speak with the Elves investigating this murder."
"103224356-0-47887";"It appears Razum-dar and Oriandra have summoned those who I've helped from across Summerset to vouch for me. I should listen as they make their case."
"103224356-0-47888";"Now that everyone has vouched for me, I need to speak to the Sapiarch and see if she'll reconsider getting additional help to protect the Crystal Tower."
"103224356-0-47892";"I managed to convince the Sapiarchs to accept help protecting the Crystal Tower, but Valsirenn still has something to tell me. I should speak to her."
"103224356-0-47893";"Valsirenn has informed me that the Psijic Order will be leaving Summerset. Now that I've said goodbye, I should go to the throne room and speak to Razum-dar."
"103224356-0-47896";"This might be the area where I'll find the stone inscribed with the ancient language. I should use the rune so Leythen can assist me."
"103224356-0-47898";"I should try to find Captain Telomure and learn what happened."
"103224356-0-47899";"A High Elf told me that a Khajiit named Razum-dar is up ahead and might need some help. I should find him and talk to him."
"103224356-0-47900";"Celinar told me about a High Elf named Esterdel who was also searching for Brengas and Niralin. He may have more information about the situation. He should be near Archon's Grove."

"103224356-0-47903";"Curtaros and I heavily damaged a Sea Elf ship. I should use this chance to make my escape from Wasten Coraldale."
"103224356-0-47904";"Now that the Queen has decreed the island of the High Elves as open for trade and travel, I should go to Summerset. A boat leaves regularly from most major cities."
"103224356-0-47906";"The Ritemaster has requested my assistance at Ceporah Tower on the island of Artaeum. I should go and see what he wants."

"103224356-0-47918";"The Augur asked to speak with me privately before I return to Loremaster Celarus. I should take it to the Athenaeum and find out what it wants."
"103224356-0-47919";"I placed the Augur on a table in Ceporah Tower's Athenaeum so we can speak at length."
"103224356-0-47920";"I gave the Augur a hearing. Perhaps I will ask it a question or two before we set out."
"103224356-0-47925";"Valsirenn is attempting to open a portal back to the Dreaming Cave. We have to survive long enough for her to succeed."

"103224356-0-47937";"With Silurie's help, I defeated the Insatiable and saved Lindafwe. We should leave the lair and plan our next move."

"103224356-0-47944";"When I locate an abyssal geyser, I need to defeat its guardians, destroy the abyssal pearl, and shut down the geyser. I need to destroy at least three geysers to disrupt the Sea Sload threat."
"103224356-0-47945";"I destroyed an abyssal geyser. I should return to Battlereeve Tanerline and let her know I disrupted the plans of the Sea Sload cabal."
"103224356-0-47950";"Oriandra has asked that I take the notes on this ancient language to Leythen. Showing them to him might convince Leythen to help us."
"103224356-0-47951";"Talomar is skeptical, but I convinced him to investigate the Conservatory. He says I might find a key on the body of one of Vinelore's rangers."
"103224356-0-47952";"Niralin was forcibly turned into a werewolf and requested I end her suffering. I agreed to this last request. I should kill her now."

"103224356-0-48210";"It seems that the Hist spoke directly to Xukas. I should talk to him and find out if he heard anything interesting about the Remnant of Argon."

"103224356-0-48212";"Kassandra believes I may learn more about the Remnant of Argon from the Dead-Water tribe. I should go to the Dead-Water Village and see if Jaxsik-Orrn can help me."

"103224356-0-48216";"Jaxsik-Orrn wants me to help her recover grave-stakes stolen by the Blackguards. Additionally, she wants me to destroy several devices keeping the bog-blights from attacking the Blackguards."
"103224356-0-48217";"Now that the fumers are destroyed and the grave-stakes are recovered, Jaxsik-Orrn wants to explore the Blackguards' central camp. I should meet her there."
"103224356-0-48218";"I found Jaxsik-Orrn standing over two bodies. I should talk to her and see if she learned anything from them."
"103224356-0-48219";"According to Jaxsik-Orrn, we might be able learn more about the Remnant of Argon from carvings on the grave-stake of a legendary Naga, Etra of the Many Spears. I need to kill Etra to claim his grave-stake."

"103224356-0-48221";"I should take Etra's grave-stake to Jaxsik-Orrn. Hopefully she can help me translate it. I can probably find her in the grave-singer's lodge in Dead-Water Village."
"103224356-0-48222";"Famia has solved the riddle and believes we should travel to Swallowed Grove. Now that the clues have been pieced together, I should talk to Kassandra about what happens next."

"103224356-0-48239";"<<1>> asked me to interview the Argonians on the list he provided while he talks to a few others. We need to see if the Blackguards approached them so we can figure out what Margus plans to do next."
"103224356-0-48240";"I spoke to all of the Argonians on my list and found out that Margus is looking for a place called Norg-Tzel to perform a ritual that will reveal the location of the cursed skull. I should  return to <<1>> and compare notes."
"103224356-0-48241";"Jee-Lar learned that three Blackguards carry pieces of a map that, once combined, show the location of where their expedition ship is moored. I need to recover two of the map pieces while Jee-Lar goes after the third."
"103224356-0-48242";"I should return to Concordia's camp outside Stormhold and see if she can make sense of these map pieces I found."
"103224356-0-48243";"Concordia assembled a map from the pieces that Jee-Lar and I recovered. It should help me locate the Blackguard expedition ship that's somewhere in the southern region of Shadowfen."
"103224356-0-48244";"I located the Blackguards' expedition ship. Now I need to find Jee-Lar and discuss our next move with him."
"103224356-0-48245";"I need to sneak aboard the Blackguards' ship and convince the pilot to take us to the forbidden island, Norg-Tzel."
"103224356-0-48247";"I need to explore the island and find Margus Derius. I should also look around and see if I can determine what the Blackguards are up to."
"103224356-0-48248";"Jee-Lar thinks that Margus Derius has entered the xanmeer to perform the ritual that will unleash the power of the cursed skull. I should enter the xanmeer and find him."
"103224356-0-48252";"I can hear Margus Derius. He's definitely started the ritual. I need to reach him."
"103224356-0-48253";"I entered the ritual chamber. Now I need to put an end to Margus's ritual."
"103224356-0-48254";"Now that I stopped Margus Derius and retrieved the Golden Skull of Beela-Kaar, I should return to the boat and leave this forbidden island."
"103224356-0-48258";"I should give the Golden Skull of Beela-Kaar to Concordia and Cyrodilic Collections for safekeeping."
"103224356-0-48259";"I have killed <<1>> and saved <<2>>. I should speak with <<3>> about what comes next."

"103224356-0-48261";"Kassandra's bodyguard, Whiptail, told me that his employer wishes to speak to me. I should visit her office in the Cyrodilic Collections headquarters and hear what she has to say."

"103224356-0-48265";"We arrived back in Root-Whisper Village with the Remnant. I should talk to Famia about our next steps."
"103224356-0-48266";"It's time to perform the ritual to free the spirits from the Remnant of Argon. I should take the Remnant to the tree. Jaxsik-Orrn is waiting for me there."
"103224356-0-48267";"Jaxsik-Orrn told me that the Blackguards are escorting Kassandra through the Deepmire on her way to the Remnant. If we want to protect the relic from Kassandra, we need to pursue her through this forbidding swamp."
"103224356-0-48268";"My companions and I entered a vast ruin called Xul-Thuxis—the Snake-Means-Death City. I should look for clues that might lead me to Kassandra."
"103224356-0-48271";"Kassandra makes her way to the Remnant while her bodyguard, Whiptail, has Famia. We should continue to pursue Kassandra while watching for an opportunity to rescue Famia."
"103224356-0-48273";"I killed the vile Whiptail and rescued Famia. I should follow her out of this place."
"103224356-0-48274";"We discovered a beautiful valley and the ruins of an old Argonian settlement, with a leafless Hist at the center. Jaxsik-Orrn rushed forward to see it. I should talk to her about what comes next."
"103224356-0-48279";"I should talk to the expedition's leader, Famia Mercius, at the docks in Lilmoth."
"103224356-0-48280";"According to Famia, the other members of her expedition are already assembling near Lilmoth's western gate. I should go there and meet my fellow explorers."
"103224356-0-48281";"A member of Famia's team flagged me down as I approached the gate. I should talk to her and see what she has to say."
"103224356-0-48282";"The Khajiit called Zadaza has been on a number of expeditions with Famia and implied this journey may be very dangerous. I can ask her more about Famia, Murkmire, and prior expeditions, or tell her I'm ready for the expedition to begin."
"103224356-0-48283";"Famia arrived at the gathering area. I should speak with her before we start our expedition."
"103224356-0-48284";"Before we set out for the xanmeer, Famia needs to meet up with some of her associates out in the swamp. Apparently, they hold vakka stones that can help us enter the xanmeer. I should accompany her and make sure she doesn't come to harm."
"103224356-0-48290";"Famia and I arrived at the hut, but Xukas has not arrived yet. I should take a look around to see if I can find any sign of Famia's associates, Eshraf and Dinia, while we wait."
"103224356-0-48294";"After searching the hut, a colorful Argonian named Xukas approached. I should speak to him."
"103224356-0-48295";"Famia indicated that she'd like to hang back and talk to Xukas about her missing explorers. I should make my way to the xanmeer. Famia should meet me there soon."
"103224356-0-48296";"Famia used the vakka stones we collected to open the door to the xanmeer. Now we can enter the ancient Argonian temple to seek out the Kajin-Jat Crystal and other treasures."
"103224356-0-48297";"We entered the Ixtaxh Xanmeer. The temple almost certainly bristles with traps. We should be cautious."
"103224356-0-48298";"Famia and I inadvertently triggered a trap that dumped us into a hidden vault beneath the entrance chamber. We should take stock and come up with a plan for escape."
"103224356-0-48299";"The trap scattered our party throughout the xanmeer. I should explore the temple with Famia and look for the other explorers. But first I need to pick the lock before we can leave this room."
"103224356-0-48300";"Famia and I managed to escape the collapsed chamber. Now we can begin our search for the other members of our party."
"103224356-0-48301";"I discovered an ancient drawbridge. Unfortunately, there is no obvious way to lower it. In order to progress, I need to decipher the clues embedded in the bridge mechanism. Once I solve the puzzle, the bridge should lower."
"103224356-0-48302";"I solved the puzzle and lowered the drawbridge. I should resume my search for the missing explorers."
"103224356-0-48303";"I found Kirstaleth, but she's in serious danger—stranded on a small ledge overlooking a yawning chasm. Famia suggested gathering a sturdy plant called flint vine. We can use the vine to make a ladder."
"103224356-0-48304";"I gathered a bundle of flint vine growing in the xanmeer. I should return to Famia and wind the vines into a ladder so we can rescue Kirstaleth."
"103224356-0-48305";"I should keep watch while Kirstaleth climbs to safety."
"103224356-0-48306";"Varo Hosidias, the party's warrior, is still missing. Kirstaleth said she heard shouting from deeper in the xanmeer. Famia and I should go investigate."
"103224356-0-48307";"We found Varo, but he appears too injured to move. Giant spiders approach from every side. I should leap to the Imperial's defense."
"103224356-0-48308";"The giant spiders are preparing to devour Varo. I need to drive back the waves of these beasts until they give up or I kill them all."
"103224356-0-48309";"We finally reunited with Zadaza. She said the Kajin-Jat Crystal is nearby, and urged me to follow her."
"103224356-0-48310";"We found a large room with strange masonry. Zadaza urged me to drop down into this peculiar pit and open the door to the next room."
"103224356-0-48311";"Dropping into the pit triggered a series of flame traps. Luckily, Zadaza was able to disable the traps and open the door. I should enter the treasure vault to see what's inside."
"103224356-0-48312";"Famia arrived ahead of us, having found another secret door that bypassed the furnace. I should follow her into the treasure vault. The Kajin-Jat Crystal is finally within reach."
"103224356-0-48313";"Famia took the Kajin-Jat Crystal from its resting place and triggered a bizarre ooze trap. I need to kill this abomination before it devours my companions."
"103224356-0-48314";"The xanmeer is filling with poison gas! My companions and I must escape before we succumb to the noxious fumes."
"103224356-0-48315";"Xukas led the expedition to a safe room, but it could fill with gas at any moment. We must escape the xanmeer quickly!"
"103224356-0-48316";"We escaped from the xanmeer. I should speak to Xukas about his reasons for aiding us."
"103224356-0-48317";"I should speak to Famia outside the xanmeer about my payment and what happened during our expedition."
"103224356-0-48318";"Famia implied that she wants to hire me for another job. She asked me to meet her back in Lilmoth to discuss the opportunity."
"103224356-0-48320";"Famia complimented me for my work in the xanmeer and implied she wants to hire me for another job. I should talk to her."
"103224356-0-48323";"Concordia assembled a map from the pieces that Jee-Lar and I recovered. With the map and the information I received from the Argonian slaves, I should be able to find the Blackguard expedition ship along the river near Deep Graves."
"103224356-0-48325";"As such, Varo Hosidias has requested that I retrieve stone tablets from a temple known as the Teeth of Sithis."
"103224356-0-48327";"I recovered ancient tablets from the Teeth of Sithis. I should bring it to Varo Hosidias back in Lilmoth."
"103224356-0-48328";"Varo Hosidias mentioned a local, named Solni, with knowledge of the Teeth of Sithis. I should speak to her before I head there."
"103224356-0-48334";"I recovered the items from the Tsofeer Cavern. Now I should return to Varo Hosidias and claim my payment."
"103224356-0-48335";"I should go to Tsofeer Cavern and locate the items that Varo wants for Tia Doran. In addition, I can talk to Tia at the Mages Guild if I have any questions."
"103224356-0-48339";"Now that we reached the island, we need to look around and find Margus and the Blackguards."
"103224356-0-48343";"Tharayya sent her crew for the gem and they informed me that she also needs an equilibrium sphere for the repairs she is working on. The skeevaton seemed to respond to this and took off. I should see where it leads me."
"103224356-0-48344";"The skeevaton lead me to a Dwarven construct that could have an equilibrium sphere. Unfortunately, it is still operational and appears to function as some sort of protector of this place. I will need to disable it before I can claim the part."
"103224356-0-48345";"With the help of the skeevaton, we were able to locate suitable parts for Tharayya's repairs. We should return to her."
"103224356-0-48346";"I defeated the Stonekeeper construct and disabled the remaining traps. Nothing stands between the Wrathstone and us now. I should speak to <<1>> about what we have found."
"103224356-0-48347";"Tharayya needs one more part before she can attempt to use the construct to open the vault door. Her skeevaton took off down a corridor, presumably in search of the shock conveyors she's asked for. I should follow it."
"103224356-0-48348";"Tharaya warned me that the ice caverns ahead are dangerous and asked me to lead the way to the Dwemer vault."
"103224356-0-48349";"The Goblins have an ice troll guarding the entrance to the Dwemer ruins. I will need to deal with it before Tharayya's crew can safely pass."
"103224356-0-48350";"The construct's Soul Gem was plundered by a Goblin warchief who doesn't seem inclined to return it. I will have to defeat him to reclaim the gem."
"103224356-0-48352";"Tharayya is working to install the parts we recovered and enact her plan to open the vault. I should wait for her to finish."
"103224356-0-48353";"I eliminated the Dwarven Sentries, but there is still a lightning field barring us from reaching the Wrathstone. Tharayya has a plan to shut it down and has asked that I help guide her skeevatons as they work in the guts of the Dwarven vault."
"103224356-0-48354";"To complete my pledge, I must thwart the defenses of the Vault of Mhuvnak and claim the Wrathstone."
"103224356-0-48355";"I succeeded in reaching the heart of Frostvault, overcoming everything that stood in my way.\n\nI should find <<1>> in my alliance's capital city."

"103224356-0-48360";"<<1>> is waiting to speak to me once again in my alliance capital."
"103224356-0-48362";"Tharayya and I have found the buried Ayleid city of Garlas Malatar. We should explore the ruins in search of another path to the surface."
"103224356-0-48363";"I entered a room containing a magical dark orb. The guardian that caused the cave in earlier has sealed me in with the orb and Daedric warriors are emerging from it. Tharayya believes destroying the orb will set me free."
"103224356-0-48364";"The guardian who has been hounding us since Tharayya took the artifact revealed himself to be an Ayleid king blessed by Meridia herself. I must defeat him to escape with the artifact."
"103224356-0-48365";"I destroyed the guardian of Garlas Malatar and found a path out of the Ayleid ruins. I should speak to <<1>> outside <<2>>."
"103224356-0-48366";"Destroying the dark orb stopped the Daedra and opened the way forward. The path forward leads us through the <<1>>, so I should expect more servants of Meridia will attempt to take the artifact from us as we pass through."
"103224356-0-48367";"Tharayya believes the Imperials who built the fort above Garlas Malatar found the artifact before calamity befell them. We should search the ruins of the fort for it."
"103224356-0-48368";"The fort's large storeroom has become the lair of a monstrous Daedra that seems to be feasting on anything and everything. I must kill the Scavenging Maw to continue my search."
"103224356-0-48369";"An unnatural permafrost blocks our passage. Its source is an Ayleid woman lamenting the sacrifice of her people. She's determined not to let us take the artifact. I must kill the Weeping Woman if we are to escape."
"103224356-0-48370";"I received a note from Tharayya informing me of another expedition on the Gold Coast. I should meet her at the ruins of Garlas Malatar."
"103224356-0-48371";"I defeated the Ayleid ruler who was guarding Garlas Malatar. Tharayya thinks she feels a breeze passing through the ruins that should lead us to the surface. I should follow it."
"103224356-0-48372";"It appears that killing the Ayleid guardian's mortal form didn't bring an end to his life. King Narilmor has become the avatar of Meridia's power and will stop at nothing to reclaim the artifact. I will have to defeat him to escape."
"103224356-0-48373";"I need to complete the Depths of Malatar."
"103224356-0-48374";"I defeated my foes in the Depths of Malatar.\n\nI should find <<1>> in my alliance's capital city."
"103224356-0-48375";"<<1>> presented me with another challenge: burn the Dictates of the Lady of Light when fighting the Symphony of Blades."

"103224356-0-48379";"<<1>> is waiting to speak to me once again in my alliance capital."
"103224356-0-48383";"I should go to Tsofeer Cavern and gather pieces of Imperial armor from the First Era for Varo to give to Tia Doran. In addition, I can talk to Tia at the Mages Guild if I have any questions."
"103224356-0-48384";"I recovered the armor from the Tsofeer Cavern. Now I should return to Varo Hosidias and claim my payment."
"103224356-0-48387";"Beel-Ranu suggested that I start by talking to Kishi's egg-sire, Bhoki. His home is inside Dead-Water Village, on the western side of the Hist."
"103224356-0-48388";"Raj-Kaal Seelan made Kishi the new war-teacher. I should congratulate Kishi on his new position in the Dead-Water tribe."
"103224356-0-48389";"Bhoki doesn't appear to be at home. I should look around and see if I can discover a clue as to where I might find him."
"103224356-0-48390";"I should use this verse to find Bhoki: ""Stand before the blue flame at the top of the stair, then turn to gaze upon our Hist so fair, walk straight into its beguiling trance, and find what you seek beneath its protective branch."""
"103224356-0-48394";"I followed the clues in the verse and found Bhoki sitting beneath the hollow of the Hist. I should talk to him."
"103224356-0-48395";"I found and freed a couple of survivors, but they are the only survivors I found.  I should meet Xode at the top of the western xanmeer as planned."
"103224356-0-48398";"Kishi was taken to the ruins at the north end of the village to die. I need to find him and rescue him before a wild animal devours him."
"103224356-0-48399";"It sounds like Famia's friend, Xukas, is approaching. I should see what he wants."
"103224356-0-48403";"I should track down the reagents Mindileth needs to create her anti-venom: gloom morel, barbleberries, and the venom of Scuttle Pit spiders."
"103224356-0-48404";"I gave Mindileth the contents of my stomach to create the anti-venom. I should talk to Jee-Lar about payment for the services I provided."
"103224356-0-48405";"I rescued Kishi. I should talk to him and tell him what his egg-sire wants him to do now."
"103224356-0-48408";"I gathered the various reagents for Mindileth's anti-venom. I should deliver the items to her."
"103224356-0-48409";"My guts are on fire! I need to make my way to the nearby cauldron and throw up into it."
"103224356-0-48410";"I should return to Concordia and share the information I received from contacts in the Outlaws Refuge with her. Namely, Margus Derius is working with the Blackguards and has hidden a number of Argonian relics in a place called the Sunless Hollow."
"103224356-0-48413";"Kishi plans to continue to oppose Mewah-Jez, the tribe's war-teacher. He claims that her teaching methods have led to the deaths of at least six seasons of the tribe's novices. I should return to Bhoki and talk to him."
"103224356-0-48414";"We found a sealed vault door that Tharayya believes she can bypass with the help of a giant Dwemer construct we discovered. She deployed a skeevaton to help me locate its missing Soul Gem. I should follow it."
"103224356-0-48416";"Mindileth insisted that I drink the noxious slurry she created. Bottoms up?"
"103224356-0-48418";"I should post handbills and dance in costume outside the Salted Wings in Vulkhel Guard, the Flaming Nix in Mournhold, and the Screaming Mermaid in Stros M'Kai"
"103224356-0-48419";"I completed my final dance. I should return to Jee-Lar to claim my payment."
"103224356-0-48432";"Tamira Dobar gave me the bug repellent candles. I should deliver them to Jee-Lar."
"103224356-0-48433";"I should gather superior dreugh wax and ash basil leaves. I can find both in Stonefalls."
"103224356-0-48434";"I gathered the materials for making the bug repellent candles. I should bring them to Tamira Dobar in Davon's Watch."
"103224356-0-48435";"Tamira wanted to test the effectiveness of the candle and unleashed a swarm of bugs on me! I should light the candle and make sure it works as intended."
"103224356-0-48440";"I decided that Haxara and her child should remain with the Bright-Throats. They need the care of a peaceful tribe to recover from the trauma they experienced. I should say my goodbyes to Tree-Minder Pavu, she will want to thank me for my help."
"103224356-0-48447";"There seems to be some sort of commotion in town. I should speak to Tree-Minder Pavu and see what's going on."
"103224356-0-48448";"The herbs I found in the egg-tenders' quarters are suspicious, but not enough to form any conclusions about. Iskenaaz suggested we head to the uxith, the nest, to check on the eggs."
"103224356-0-48449";"I found more of the dragonthorn plants among an empty nest. The egg-tenders claim that the eggs were unwell and returned to the Hist. Both seemed agitated at the idea that something is wrong with the clutch. I should speak to Iskenaaz about this."
"103224356-0-48450";"Tsadeesi, one of the Bright-Throats, asked me to give word to Tree-Minder Pavu that she will arrive soon with needed supplies. I should head to Bright-Throat Village and speak with the tree-minder."
"103224356-0-48452";"The egg-tenders are acting oddly, but my only real lead is some suspicious dragonthorn plants found at the uxith and the egg-tenders' quarters. Iskenaaz says the tribe cultivates it at a dry glade nearby. We should head there to see what we can find."
"103224356-0-48454";"Another sick Argonian, like the one brought to Bright-Throat Village, stumbled into the glade and died as Iskenaaz and I were talking. I should examine it."
"103224356-0-48455";"Iskenaaz believes that the creatures are being sent by the Veeskhleel to poison his tribe and Hist. He suggests we try to follow the creature's trail back to its origin and root out the Veeskhleel."
"103224356-0-48456";"Iskenaaz and I were able to follow the shed scales back to a swampy, foul-smelling cavern. We should head inside and see what lurks within."
"103224356-0-48457";"Haxara is inconsolable. She claims that the creatures are her children. That seems unlikely, but the room reeks of alchemical odors. We should look around for clues about what the Veeskhleel are doing in here."
"103224356-0-48458";"We found the body of an Argonian in the drying hut at the glade. He possessed a note instructing him to kill Haxara. I also found her journal. This is proof she's been helping steal eggs. I should show Iskenaaz what I found."
"103224356-0-48461";"Iskenaaz left to warn his tribe about what we discovered in this cavern, but Haxara insists on staying while I deal with the Veeskhleel and their creations. She said we may be able to follow the poison fumes given off by her children to locate them."
"103224356-0-48465";"Haxara is hanging on by a thread, but she insists that she has to see this through. We need to find Ree-Nakal and the last experiment she's hatching to end this once and for all."
"103224356-0-48467";"Ree-Nakal is dead along with almost all her experiments. Haxara has found one remaining child that appears to be healthy and docile. I should speak to her about this discovery."
"103224356-0-48468";"Haxara begged me not to kill the last of her children and I see no reason to do so. She wants to take the girl back to the Bright-Throat Village. I should head back there as well."
"103224356-0-48469";"The arrival of Haxara and her strange child has stirred up a commotion for the tree-minder. She's called for quiet and invited me to speak with her."
"103224356-0-48470";"Tree-Minder Pavu will defer to my judgment concerning what should be done about Haxara and her child. Iskenaaz and Haxara seem to have more to say on the matter. I could hear them out, or give Pavu my decision based on what I already know."
"103224356-0-48471";"Famia believes the riddle points to a cavern upriver, known as the Swallowed Grove. I should make my way there."
"103224356-0-48472";"Jaxsik-Orrn and Xukas suggested we split up to cover more ground. Famia and I should search the cavern for any sign of the Remnant of Argon."
"103224356-0-48473";"Kassandra has offered the use of her boat in travelling to the caves."
"103224356-0-48475";"I should make my way through the rest of the Swallowed Grove. Our destination should be just within reach."
"103224356-0-48476";"The party reconvened outside an ancient Argonian ritual chamber, inside the Swallowed Grove. I should enter the chamber and see how it relates to the Remnant of Argon."
"103224356-0-48477";"Xukas and Jaxsik entered the Dreaming Nest and began performing a dream-wallow ceremony based on the riddle we uncovered. I should watch and see what happens."
"103224356-0-48478";"My mind is reeling! A tangle of roots parted to reveal an ancient mural. I should see what I can learn from it."
"103224356-0-48479";"In touching the mural, my consciousness was transported to a distant, dreamy marsh. And my body has taken on the aspect of an unfamiliar Argonian. I should explore the marsh. Perhaps I'll find some sign of the Remnant here."
"103224356-0-48480";"Kloxu and the rest of the Argonian hunting party tasked me with killing Fat Gixthi, a wamasu they drew out of hiding. I should defeat the beast to continue the vision."
"103224356-0-48481";"One of the members of Kloxu's hunting party has gone missing. Perhaps in finding him, I'll learn more about why I'm here."
"103224356-0-48482";"I encountered a party of Ayleid soldiers in my vision before being sent back to the Dreaming Nest. A new mural appeared—one depicting an Argonian village. I should investigate it."
"103224356-0-48483";"The dream-wallow sent me to the scarred ruins of an Argonian village—once again, in the form of Mateem. An Argonian war-chief named Raj-Kaal Druxith wishes to speak to me. I should see what he has to say."
"103224356-0-48484";"The Argonian war-chief, Raj-Kaal Druxith, tasked me with gathering four members of the sap-speaker's ""sacred clutch."" I should find these four Argonians, and send them to the center of town."
"103224356-0-48485";"I found the four Argonians. I should return to the center of the village to see if Raj-Kaal Druxith needs anything else."
"103224356-0-48487";"My vision of the besieged village ended and I returned to the Dreaming Nest. Soon after, a new mural has appeared, showing the image of a Hist Tree. I should investigate it."
"103224356-0-48488";"The dream-wallow took me to a strange cavern. I should investigate this mysterious passage."
"103224356-0-48489";"I found a sap-speaker and other surviving members of the tribe in the caverns beneath a Hist Tree. Ayleid soldiers will attack any minute. I should listen to Sap-Speaker Kuzei."
"103224356-0-48490";"The tribal elders, led by Sap-Speaker Kuzei, are creating the Remnant of Argon. I must protect the sap-speaker from the Ayleid forces until she completes the ritual."
"103224356-0-48491";"Sap-Speaker Kuzei has offered me her staff, claiming that it is the key to finding the Remnant of Argon. I should take the staff."
"103224356-0-48492";"After emerging from the vision, Kassandra quickly betrayed the party and stole the staff in order to claim the Remnant of Argon for herself. I should speak to Xukas about what to do next."
"103224356-0-48493";"I gathered both the meat and the salt that Jee-Lar requested. I should deliver these items to him so I can collect my reward."
"103224356-0-48494";"I must stalk the hills and forests of The Rift to find mammoth meat for Jee-Lar."
"103224356-0-48495";"I gathered the meat Jee-Lar requested. I should meet with the salt-maker, Hervod, to acquire some curing salt."
"103224356-0-48496";"Hervod invited me to drink with him. I can either grease his palm for the salt so I can be on my way, or accept his hospitality and stay for a drink."
"103224356-0-48497";"I caught up to Hervod's level of inebriation. I should talk to him."
"103224356-0-48498";"An Argonian called me by an unfamiliar name—Mateem. He urged me to meet a hunting party. I should find the hunters' encampment."
"103224356-0-48503";"Priestess Hodyette is currently at her camp in the mountains of Eastmarch. I should go there and implore her to help the expedition."
"103224356-0-48504";"I found Priestess Hodyette's camp. I should talk to her and see if she will agree to help the expedition."
"103224356-0-48505";"Priestess Hodyette requested that I scream into the wind in order to commune with Kyne, absorbing her energy within a rune. In order to do this I must find several scenic vistas around Eastmarch."
"103224356-0-48506";"I successfully communed with Kyne and absorbed her energy within the rune. I should return to Priestess Hodyette's camp and talk to her."
"103224356-0-48507";"Priestess Hodyette has agreed to give a weather prediction to Cyrodilic Collections. I should return to Jee-Lar and tell him the good news."
"103224356-0-48514";"Jee-Lar told me that a trapper named Arlowe Viducia has copper-tongued skinks on hand. I should seek him out in the Redguard city of Sentinel."
"103224356-0-48515";"The copper-tongued skink escaped! Arlowe insists that venom sacs from the assassin beetles and giant scorpions of Alik'r will lure the lizard back out of hiding. I should acquire three of these sacs."
"103224356-0-48516";"I acquired the venom sacs. I should place them at the location Arlowe marked on the map."
"103224356-0-48517";"I lured the toxin-sniffing skink out with the venom sac. Now I just need to catch it."
"103224356-0-48519";"I caught the copper-tongued skink. I should deliver it to Jee-Lar."
"103224356-0-48522";"I agreed to drink with Hervod. I should grab his spare mug and help myself to his mead."
"103224356-0-48523";"I placed the sacred candles in the cave as requested. Now I should return to Varo Hosidias and claim my payment"
"103224356-0-48524";"I should go to the cavern and place the sacred Argonian candles beside the remains of any Imperials I find. If I have any questions, I can talk to Tia Doran at the Mages Guild."
"103224356-0-48529";"The bug repellent candle seems to work. I should talk to Tamira Dobar."
"103224356-0-48533";"Nesh-Deeka asked me to talk to a few people around town who have dealt with Captain Jimila in the past. He wants to learn enough about the Captain to make a good impression."
"103224356-0-48535";"I spoke to a few of the people in Lilmoth who have worked with Captain Jimila in the past. Now I should talk to Nesh-Deeka and let him know what I found out."
"103224356-0-48536";"Nesh-Deeka suggested I start by gathering the moss-foot croakers from the marsh east of Lilmoth. If I need additional information, I can refer to the written instructions he provided me with."
"103224356-0-48537";"Next I need to find a ruby hopper. They like to sun themselves on stones near water around Lilmoth."
"103224356-0-48538";"To catch the next frog on the list, the indigo tree frog, I need to locate a grove of trees where they have congregated."
"103224356-0-48539";"I found a grove of trees housing the indigo tree frogs. Now I need to gather fleshflies to use as a lure to get the frogs out of the trees."
"103224356-0-48540";"I gathered fleshflies. Now I need to release the flies beneath the trees to lure the tree frogs down so I can capture a few of them."
"103224356-0-48541";"The indigo tree frogs have descended from the trees to feast on the flies. I should grab a few of them before they hop away."
"103224356-0-48542";"To attract the elusive sun-blessed toad, I need to gather ingredients to make an odoriferous musk that will trick them into emerging from their mud pit. I need to find the following plants: stench sedge, salt rush, and joymallow."
"103224356-0-48543";"I gathered the ingredients. Now I need to mix them together to create the pungent toad musk."
"103224356-0-48544";"I created enough toad musk to attract the sun-blessed toads. Now I need to locate a toad mud pit and see if it contains any of the yellow toads."
"103224356-0-48545";"According to Nesh-Deeka's instructions, I need to pour the musk onto myself to attract the attention of the sun-blessed toads."
"103224356-0-48548";"Now that I'm drenched in the musk, I need to turn the crank of the croak-wheel to simulate the sound of a frisky toad. Between the smell and the sound, it should attract a sun-blessed toad."
"103224356-0-48549";"The combination of sound and smell lured a sun-blessed toad out of the mud pit. I need to catch it for the vossa-satl."
"103224356-0-48550";"I gathered all of the frogs Nesh-Deeka asked for. I should return to Lilmoth and talk to him."
"103224356-0-48551";"I gave the frogs I gathered to Nesh-Deeka. Now I should follow him into his shop and see how the vossa-satl works."
"103224356-0-48552";"I should stay out of the way while Nesh-Deeka tunes the vossa-satl."
"103224356-0-48553";"I need to find Captain Jimila at the Lilmoth tavern, give her the vossa-satl, and then attempt to convince her to agree to a deal to export them for Nesh-Deeka."
"103224356-0-48564";"Captain Jimila agreed to take five of the vossa-satls and see how they sell. I should inform Nesh-Deeka that he has a deal."
"103224356-0-48569";"I successfully protected Sap-Speaker Kuzei, allowing her to finish creating the Remnant of Argon. I should speak to her to learn more about what I just witnessed."
"103224356-0-48576";"Kassandra has requested a meeting with me. I should travel to her office in Lilmoth and see what she wishes to discuss."
"103224356-0-48580";"Balorgh has killed Hanu and stolen the indrik heart in order to win Hircine's boon. I should hunt him down and prevent this from happening."
"103224356-0-48584";"Nesh-Deeka seems happy with the way the instrument sounds. He wants me to take it so I can present it to Captain Jimila."
"103224356-0-48585";"We caught up to Kassandra, and my companions set off in pursuit. Unfortunately, Famia is still in danger. I need to find her and save her from the gruesome fate that Whiptail has planned."
"103224356-0-48588";"Famia and Kassandra were relieved to hear that Xukas and I are making progress toward finding the missing explorers. I should meet up with Xukas outside Bright-Throat Village so we can continue our investigation."
"103224356-0-48589";"Famia wants to speak to me. I should visit her office in Lilmoth as soon as I can."
"103224356-0-48590";"Xukas arranged a meeting with a Dead-Water representative just outside Bright-Throat Village. I should head to the meeting place."
"103224356-0-48591";"Jaxsik-Orrn, a Dead-Water warrior, arrived to meet us. I should attempt to negotiate with her."
"103224356-0-48592";"Our meeting with Jaxsik-Orrn was very brief. She told us the Dead-Water tribe would hunt the Blackguards alone, and urged us to leave. Maybe Xukas can provide some insight. I should talk to him."
"103224356-0-48593";"Xukas believes Jaxsik-Orrn is stalking one of the Blackguards. We should track her to find out what she's planning."
"103224356-0-48594";"Xukas believes Jaxsik-Orrn is stalking one of the Blackguards. We should track her to find out what she's planning."
"103224356-0-48595";"Xukas believes Jaxsik-Orrn is stalking one of the Blackguards. We should track her to find out what she's planning."
"103224356-0-48596";"We found Jaxsik-Orrn observing a Blackguard caravan. I should talk to her to learn her intentions."
"103224356-0-48597";"Blackguard mercenaries abducted Dead-Water Nagas as well as Famia's explorers. I should help Jaxsik-Orrn burn the Blackguard's wagons, destroy their supply crates, and free all the prisoners."
"103224356-0-48606";"I finished demolishing the Blackguard caravan and freeing the captives. I should rejoin Jaxsik-Orrn and Xukas."
"103224356-0-48607";"Jaxsik-Orrn captured a Blackguard who was trying to escape. Xukas seems to be holding her at bay. I should speak to Jaxsik-Orrn to see if she learned anything."
"103224356-0-48608";"Jaxsik-Orrn wants to execute the Blackguard captive. However, the woman surrendered voluntarily and presents no threat. I should see what Xukas thinks about the situation."
"103224356-0-48609";"Xukas believes it would be better to release the woman, Hostia, so she can warn the Blackguards not to attack the Dead-Water tribe again. I should interrogate Hostia and find out what she knows."
"103224356-0-48610";"The Blackguards are abducting and interrogating explorers and local Nagas—looking for information on something called the Remnant of Argon. Now that I know the truth, I can encourage Jaxsik-Orrn to execute Hostia or let Xukas free her."
"103224356-0-48611";"I allowed Xukas to release Hostia, against Jaxsik-Orrn's wishes. Perhaps Xukas can tell me more about this Remnant of Argon."
"103224356-0-48612";"Xukas and Jaxsik-Orrn agree on one thing: the Remnant of Argon must not fall into the wrong hands. I should return to Famia and tell her what I learned."
"103224356-0-48613";"Famia was pleased that I rescued her explorers, and urged me to speak to her benefactor, Kassandra. I should see what kind of offer Kassandra has for me."
"103224356-0-48615";"Kassandra wants to both reward me for the help I've given Cyrodilic Collections so far, and offer me another job to perform. I should collect my payment and learn what she wants of me."

"103224356-0-48617";"The ritual consumed Margus Derius, but I still have to stop it. Jar-Lee suggests that I need to disengage each cylinder to deactivate the flow of energy."

"103224356-0-48619";"Now I need to disengage the third ritual cylinder."
"103224356-0-48620";"Now I need to disengage the fourth ritual cylinder and that should end the flow of energy and stop the ritual."
"103224356-0-48621";"Disengaging the ritual cylinders unlocked a door at the back of the chamber and revealed the hiding place of the cursed skull. I need to defeat the final guardian before I can claim the relic."
"103224356-0-48631";"I allowed Jaxsik-Orrn to execute Hostia, against Xukas's wishes. Perhaps Jaxsik-Orrn can tell me more about this Remnant of Argon."
"103224356-0-48632";"I need to go into the swamp and use the fire stones on the tamed vine-tongues. Bhoki says that the plants will lead me to Kishi's hidden camp."

"103224356-0-48642";"I found an intact vakka stone hidden in a maze of Ayleid laboratories. I should take it back to Famia. Hopefully it will activate the Ayleid gate and allow us to pass through to the next leg of our journey."
"103224356-0-48645";"The vakka stone activated the mysterious Ayleid gate. I must pass through it to continue pursuing Kassandra."
"103224356-0-48646";"I caught sight of Kassandra, who seems intent on stopping Famia and I from going any farther. I need to make my way to the Remnant, even if it means going through her."
"103224356-0-48647";"Kassandra fled deeper into the cavern—perhaps to the final Remnant chamber. I need to follow her."
"103224356-0-48648";"Kassandra touched the Remnant of Argon—resulting in an explosion of vines, and the emergence of a miregaunt with her inside. I must defeat Kassandra, and the creature she occupies."
"103224356-0-48649";"I was forced to kill Kassandra, but Famia managed to retrieve the Remnant of Argon without any ill effects. We should take the relic back to the surface."
"103224356-0-48652";"Kishi wants to mentor me and help me walk the Path of the Lily to prove that Bhoki's techniques are superior to Mewah-Jez's approach. To do this, we need to obtain permission from the tribe's war-chief, Raj-Kaal Seelan."
"103224356-0-48654";"Raj-Kaal Seelan has agreed to let me walk the Path of the Lily. I should meet Kishi at the entrance so we can begin the rite of passage."

"103224356-0-48675";"I decided that Haxara and her child don't belong among the Bright-Throats. They have been exiled and will have to make a new life for themselves elsewhere. I should say my goodbyes to Tree-Minder Pavu, she will want to thank me for my help."

"103224356-0-48690";"I collected some old remains from the Teeth of Sithis. I should bring them to Varo Hosidias and collect my pay."

"103224356-0-48713";"Famia asked me to find Xukas. I should talk to him and urge him to join Famia beneath the Hist."
"103224356-0-48714";"I delivered the message to Xukas and Jaxsik-Orrn. Now I should return to Famia beneath the Hist tree."
"103224356-0-48715";"Famia urged us to touch the Remnant of Argon. She believes that this will allow us to help the Argonian spirits trapped inside it."
"103224356-0-48716";"My companions and I touched the Remnant of Argon and found ourselves magically transported inside it. I should take a look around with Xukas and Jaxsik-Orrn."
"103224356-0-48717";"A spirit that resembles the Sap-Speaker I saw in my dream-wallow vision wants to speak to me. I should see what she has to say."
"103224356-0-48718";"The spirits need a guide to leave the Remnant of Argon safely. The Sap-Speaker claims Xukas and Jaxsik-Orrn are both suited for this task. Now I need to help them decide which one will stay behind."
"103224356-0-48719";"I chose to let Xukas stay behind to guide the spirits safely back to the Hist. Now Jaxsik-Orrn and I need to leave the Remnant."
"103224356-0-48720";"I chose to let Jaxsik-Orrn stay behind to guide the spirits safely back to the Hist. Now Xukas and I need to leave the Remnant."

"103224356-0-48739";"I found a page from a journal written by an officer of the Imperial Ninth Legion. It mentions Dradeiva's ancestor and suggests that something happened to the Legion in this cavern. I should search for more clues as to the fate of the Lost Legion."
"103224356-0-48741";"I should talk to Kassandra about the clues I found regarding the Remnant of Argon. I can probably find both her and Famia in the Cyrodilic Collections headquarters."

"103224356-0-48779";"Jaxsik-Orrn already pursues Kassandra into the perilous Deepmire. I might be able to catch up to her if I hurry."

"103224356-0-48835";"The misshapen creature was missing most of its scales. They come off at the slightest touch. It likely lost a lot of them trekking through the swamp. I should see what Iskenaaz thinks of all this."
"103224356-0-48843";"The skeevaton lead me to a scrap pile the Goblins have accumulated. Unfortunately, their shaman and his ice atronach are busy picking through the loot. I'll need to deal with them before we can search for the shock conveyors."

"103224356-0-48883";"While examining evidence where Guhcin encountered the Skin Taker, I heard someone cry out in pain nearby. With a killer about I should find the source of the cry as quickly as I can."
"103224356-0-48884";"I found a dying Blackguard caught in an Argonian trap. Guhcin said the Skin Taker was dressed as a Blackguard. I should question him before he succumbs to his injuries."
"103224356-0-48885";"The Skin Taker is Hostia Asellus, the Blackguard slaver I spared when Jaxsik wanted to kill her. That incident seems to have escalated Hostia's grudge against Argonians to new heights. I have to stop her before she can kill again."
"103224356-0-48887";"The Skin Taker is Julitta Asellus, daughter of the Blackguard slaver I let Jaxsik execute for abducting Dead-Water tribe members. These killings are her vengeance on the Murkmire tribes. I have to stop her before she can kill again."

"103224356-0-48889";"I found Julitta in her hideout near the Dead-Water tribe's village. She made it clear she will not surrender without a fight."
"103224356-0-48890";"Hostia left me no choice but to kill her to put an end to the Skin Taker murders. It looks like she kept a journal that might shed some light on her horrific actions."
"103224356-0-48891";"The Skin Taker is dead and the evidence of her motives is in hand. I should return to Dead-Water Village and see if Dejaleen arrived safely."
"103224356-0-48892";"Dajaleen regrets that my act of mercy allowed for this tragedy to unfold, but she's hopeful that these events have brought the Bright-Throats and Dead-Water tribes closer together. My work here is finished. I should say goodbye to Dajaleen."
"103224356-0-48893";"I spoke to Xukas and Jaxsik-Orrn. Now it's up to me to choose who will guide the souls back to the Hist. Either Xukas or Jaxsik-Orrn must stay behind to save the souls of this ancient tribe."
"103224356-0-48895";"I've found the Root-House tribe's campsite. I should speak to one of their members and find out if they've seen Hands-That-Heal's wooden box."
"103224356-0-48896";"Tem-Tei has the wooden box, but won't part with it for free. If I'm to be given the box, I must enter the Blackguard's campsite and steal back her hunting bow."

"103224356-0-48898";"Tem-Tei has agreed to give me the branch within the wooden box. I should collect it so it can be returned to Hands-That-Heal."

"103224356-0-48915";"The next part of the Path requires me to get past poisonous plants. I can use Kishi's arrow to direct him to help me overcome the plants. During this challenge, I have to ignite two signal totems."

"103224356-0-48919";"I've collected the hammer. I should return to Nisswo Uaxal."
"103224356-0-48923";"Milzus didn't have much new information to offer, but she told me that another Argonian, a Dead-Water hunter named Sulosya, found one of the other victims. She suggested he may be more helpful, and said I could find him at Alten Meerhleel."
"103224356-0-48924";"I learned a bit more about the Skin Taker's methods from Sulosya, but he also provided another lead. One of his Dead-Water tribesmen encountered the Skin Taker and chased the killer off. I should speak to Guhcin at the Dead-Water Village."
"103224356-0-48926";"The thief left a book of riddles at the scene of the crime, describing the location of every tablet. I should collect the book to help my search."
"103224356-0-48927";"I should take the grave-stake."
"103224356-0-48928";"I should find the grave-singer mentioned in the note. It sounds like she's somewhere near Bright-Throat Village."
"103224356-0-48929";"Grave-Singer Xaleez asked me to place the grave-stake in a glade north of Bright-Throat Village. I should head there now and plant the grave-stake."
"103224356-0-48930";"I placed the grave-stake in the glade, causing a small tree to appear. I should let Grave-Singer Xaleez know that I completed my task."
"103224356-0-48932";"<<1>> asked me to capture four swamp jellies of assorted colors with a net she provided. She suggested I should be able to locate the vocal ones by sound."

"103224356-0-48944";"Lady Laurent asked me to find the hand-mirror that her manservant lost in the nearby swamp."

"103224356-0-48946";"I helped Stibbons extract himself from the mud. Now I should talk to Lady Laurent and see if there's anything else I can do to help."
"103224356-0-48948";"Now that I have the renewal charm, I should meet Lady Laurent in the Renewal Lodge north of the Bright-Throat Village."

"103224356-0-48972";"I should focus on the prayer-stone Chime-Maker Shuvu gave me and witness this rite of the chimes."
"103224356-0-48979";"I've collected the aloe. I should travel back to Tuwul in Root-Whisper Village in order to collect my reward."
"103224356-0-48980";"I should head into Vakka-Bok Xanmeer and collect the aloe."

"103224356-0-48988";"I should head to the Blight Bog Sump in order to collect the mushrooms."
"103224356-0-48989";"I could ask for more information."
"103224356-0-48991";"Jaxsik-Orrn reluctantly agreed to work with me—just long enough to deal with the Blackguards. I can ask her more questions about what we're up against, or begin my assault on the caravan."
"103224356-0-48992";"Lady Laurent asked me to accompany Stibbons to the Swallowed Grove to confront Many-Whispers and try to acquire a renewal charm."
"103224356-0-48993";"Many-Whispers agreed to trade a renewal charm if I bring him a key. I can find the key on the body of his associate somewhere in the Swallowed Grove."
"103224356-0-48994";"I recovered the key. Now I should return to Many-Whispers and trade it for the renewal charm that Lady Laurent has been looking for."
"103224356-0-48995";"Lady Laurent volunteered Stibbons to take part in the ritual. I need to help him prepare by aligning his blood, bile, and mind in the prescribed fashion."

"103224356-0-49035";"Guhcin regrets that Jaxsik's act of retribution allowed for this tragedy to unfold, but he believes they might avoid repeating it by learning tolerance from the Bright-Throats. My work here is finished. I should say goodbye to Guhcin."
"103224356-0-49036";"Julitta left me no choice but to kill her to put an end to the Skin Taker murders. It looks like she kept her mother's journal close at hand. It might shed some light on her horrific actions."
"103224356-0-49037";"Xukas appears to have found something interesting. I should speak to him."
"103224356-0-49038";"I found Jaxsik-Orrn. I should talk to her."
"103224356-0-49043";"Xukas and Jaxsik-Orrn used the reagents they found to create a potent mind-altering smoke. I must breathe it in to begin the dream-wallow."
"103224356-0-49044";"Kloxu and a number of other Argonians are gathered around a campfire. I should listen to what they have to say. Perhaps I'll learn why I was sent here."
"103224356-0-49055";"I didn't find anything unusual in the egg-tenders' quarters other than a hidden parcel of a common herb. I should show it to Iskenaaz and see what he thinks."
"103224356-0-49059";"I convinced all the visiting suitors to rejoin the bonding ritual. I should speak to Bond-Guru Topeth and give him the good news."

"103224356-0-49073";"The bonding ritual has concluded and the festivities are underway as the newly bonded prepare for their night ahead. I should give my best to Bond-Guru Topeth before moving on."
"103224356-0-49078";"Beehuna begrudgingly agreed to join the bonding ritual now that her people's custom has been met. That leaves only the Moss-Skin suitor lacking in attendance. I should speak with them."
"103224356-0-49079";"I located Deed-Tei's lost seed doll in a haj mota den. I should retrieve it before something else decides to run off with it."
"103224356-0-49080";"Now that I have the seed-doll, I should bring it to Deed-Tei and convince him to join the bonding ritual."
"103224356-0-49081";"Now that the Black-Tongues are prepared for the bonding ritual, I should look into what's keeping the Root-House suitor from joining in the ritual."
"103224356-0-49082";"I have Beehuna's dowry in hand. I should bring it to her and see if she'll agree to participate in the bonding ritual now."
"103224356-0-49083";"I agreed to help Bond-Guru Topeth with whatever is holding up the suitors long overdue for the bonding ritual. He suggests starting with a visit to the Black-Tongue suitor in the nearby pavilion."
"103224356-0-49084";"Waku-Mat agreed to serve as replacement suitor if we can create another batch of the Black-Tongue's blessed elixir. He's asked me to find a rare plant called Leviathan Pizzle and provided a sketch to help me identify it. Now I just need to find one."
"103224356-0-49085";"Now that I recovered the Leviathan Pizzle, I should bring it to Waku-Mat and convince him to take part in the bonding ritual."
"103224356-0-49087";"Waku-Mat agreed to serve as replacement suitor if we can create another batch of the Black-Tongue's blessed elixir. He's asked me to find a rare plant called Leviathan Pizzle and provided a sketch to help me identify it. I should take the sketch."
"103224356-0-49091";"Beehuna refuses to join in the bonding ritual until the dowry she claimed is returned to her. She says that the guards took it and gave it to the Bright-Throat store-keeper to hide from her. I should speak to the store-keeper about retrieving it."
"103224356-0-49092";"Naheesh Oleen's reminder contained a riddle pointing to another hiding spot. I should try to find it."
"103224356-0-49093";"I solved another of Naheesh Oleen's clues. Unsurprisingly, all I discovered was another note with another hint. I will have to continue my search."
"103224356-0-49094";"I solved three of Naheesh Olean's riddles, but it's unclear if I'm any closer to retrieving the dowry. I should puzzle out the forth riddle and see where it takes me."
"103224356-0-49095";"It seems Naheesh Oleen did not expect Beehuna to get this far in her search. He left a note behind for his assistant Cheesh-Nassa, pointing to a crate in the storehouse with a false bottom. I should head there and retrieve the dowry."
"103224356-0-49096";"A storehouse attendant named Cheesh-Nassa informed me that the store-keeper is away dealing with a personal matter. If I hope to find Beehuna's dowry, I'll have to follow the trail of clues the store-keeper left behind to antagonize her."
"103224356-0-49097";"The Moss-Skin suitor, Deed-Tei, has declined to participate from the ceremony because he has lost a precious gift made for him by his betrothed. He said a haj mota snatched it out of his hands by the guloo bridge. I should start my search there."
"103224356-0-49103";"Bond-Guru Topeth was so grateful for my help with the suitors that he's invited me to begin the ceremony. I should signal when I'm ready for the rite to begin."
"103224356-0-49105";"Xukas suggested I go to the Glade of Chimes and speak with Shuvu, chime-maker of the Bright-Throats."
"103224356-0-49106";"Xukas believes Chime-Maker Shuvu may know something about the Remnant of Argon. I should speak with him."
"103224356-0-49107";"Chime-Maker Shuvu can ask the Hist about the Remnant of Argon, but needs a special chime to do so. I can find it in a vault north of the village."
"103224356-0-49108";"I should find the Remnant Chime and take it back to Bright-Throat Village."
"103224356-0-49109";"I should return to Bright-Throat Village and ask Shuvu what to do with the Remnant Chime."
"103224356-0-49110";"Shuvu instructed me to hang the Remnant Chime on one of the Listening-Tree's branches."
"103224356-0-49111";"Famia informed me that Xukas has been looking for information on the people who went missing from Cyrodilic Collections. He may know something. I should be able to find him at Alten Meerhleel, outside Lilmoth."
"103224356-0-49112";"Xukas believes that a thuggish mercantile organization called the Dragonstar Caravan Company might have some information on the missing explorers. He needs me to distract one of the company's couriers—an Orc named Lozwug—so he can pickpocket him."
"103224356-0-49113";"I should make small talk with Lozwug, long enough for Xukas to sneak up behind him and pickpocket the correspondence he carries."
"103224356-0-49114";"Xukas snatched a piece of correspondence from Lozwug's purse. I should speak to Xukas to find out what he stole and how it will help us find Famia's missing explorers."
"103224356-0-49115";"According to Xukas, the correspondence he stole from Lozwug contains copious notes on Famia—information vital to someone planning to kidnap her. Xukas thinks we can find more information in the Dragonstar Caravan Company depot in Lilmoth."
"103224356-0-49116";"I retrieved a number of interesting items from the Dragonstar Caravan Company depot. I should show them to Xukas and see what he thinks."
"103224356-0-49117";"I learned that the Blackguards have been kidnapping Famia's friends. Xukas believes that the Dead-Water tribe might know more about the disappearances. He urged me to inform Famia while he sets up a meeting with his Dead-Water friend, Jaxsik-Orrn."
"103224356-0-49118";"Famia urged me to talk to her primary benefactor, Kassandra. I should introduce myself."
"103224356-0-49121";"Don't Kill Anyone at the Depot"
"103224356-0-49125";"I told Xukas what happened when I infiltrated the Dragonstar Caravan Company depot. Hopefully the clues I retrieved will help us determine the whereabouts of the missing explorers."
"103224356-0-49126";"Xukas finally returned from his journey to Lilmoth and the tribal villages. I should speak to him about what comes next."
"103224356-0-49131";"I learned a clue about the Remnant of Argon. ""Smoke of stars to see what once was seen, sunless sap to hear what once was heard."" I should tell Kassandra, who is currently in Alten Meerhleel."
"103224356-0-49132";"Famia urged me to meet Kassandra at some ruins west of Alten Meerhleel. I should go find her."
"103224356-0-49133";"I found Kassandra and her bodyguard, Whiptail, standing over a body. I should find out what happened."
"103224356-0-49134";"Kassandra asked me to find clues that her dead contact, Heetzasi, might have dug up regarding the Remnant. I should search the camp."
"103224356-0-49135";"I found some clues about the Remnant of Argon. I should talk to Kassandra about them."
"103224356-0-49147";"I should search for the missing kaals."
"103224356-0-49148";"I stumbled upon a group of Ayleids trying to escape the village. I should cut them down."
"103224356-0-49149";"I rescued one of the missing kaals—Kaal Droran. I should urge her to return to the center of the village."
"103224356-0-49150";"I should talk to Famia to learn our next move."
"103224356-0-49152";"I found evidence that Ree-Nakal, the Veeskhleel leader, has been experimenting on stolen eggs to try and give them life, resulting in the creatures we've encountered so far. I should let Iskenaaz and Haxara know the ugly truth."
"103224356-0-49162";"Stibbons transformed into an egg after attending the renewal ritual. I should talk to Lady Laurent and see if she knows what happened."
"103224356-0-49168";"Famia indicated that her fellow explorers might have returned to a hut they often use as a meeting spot. She also plans to meet a friendly Argonian there named Xukas. I should accompany her to this hut to ensure she doesn't come to harm."
"103224356-0-49169";"It says I should seek out Bolu in Lilmoth. I should travel there and speak to him."
"103224356-0-49170";"Bolu told me that he has many Death-Hunts to offer from the Naga-Kur. I should let him know that I'm interested in joining one."
"103224356-0-49178";"With the Scavenging Maw slain I should be able to continue my exploration of Fort Mistwatch."
"103224356-0-49179";"Tharayya found the artifact she was searching for in some sort of Imperial shrine beneath the fort. Claiming the artifact alerted some sort of guardian that caused a cave in, trapping us. I should search for a way out."
"103224356-0-49180";"Leaping down into the caverns below appeared to be our only option. Tharayya insists there must be another exit from Garlas Malatar."
"103224356-0-49184";"Examine the Crumbled Wall"
"103224356-0-49188";"Zadaza urged me to talk to Xukas about our next move in pursuing Kassandra. I should track him down, outside the Swallowed Grove."
"103224356-0-49189";"Zadaza asked me to find Famia and discuss our next move in pursuing Kassandra. Famia should be somewhere in the deep swamp."
"103224356-0-49190";"Zadaza suggested I locate Famia and make sure she's all right. She thinks she may be in the deep swamp."
"103224356-0-49193";"Xukas appears to have found something interesting. I should follow him."
"103224356-0-49194";"According to Xukas, Jaxsik-Orrn likely found something interesting. I should seek her out."
"103224356-0-49202";"Our attempts to overload the Dwarven defenses only managed to activate another countermeasure. A massive construct has emerged to stop our attempts at claiming the Wrathstone. Destroying it is our only option."
"103224356-0-49203";"Gharesh-ri put Khamira in charge of the defense of Riverhold. I should find her and see what I can do to help."
"103224356-0-49204";"Khamira sent me to the Greenleaf Farm to convince the farmers to get inside the town before Euraxia's forces arrive. Zamarak asked to tag along to help me."
"103224356-0-49205";"Khamira wants me to cause mayhem and destruction at the Euraxian supply camps by scaring off their horses and setting fire to their carts. The confusion should also allow Nala-do's soldiers to steal some supplies for the militia."
"103224356-0-49206";"Captain Nala-do asked me to head to the road south of Riverhold to help Cadwell set traps of his own design. I wonder if these traps will really hinder the approaching Euraxian army?"
"103224356-0-49207";"Cadwell asked me to help him arm the traps he set along the road. I should arm them before the Euraxians arrives. Carefully."
"103224356-0-49208";"After I armed the traps, Cadwell acted strangely. Well, more strange than usual. It seems like he had another one of his dream-visions. I should talk to him about it."
"103224356-0-49211";"Abnur Tharn has a plan for how to deal with Euraxia. I should talk to him and find out what it entails."
"103224356-0-49214";"The council meeting has ended and Khamira wants to talk to me. I should let her know what we found in the Dragonguard sanctuary."
"103224356-0-49215";"After we found a number of intriguing clues among Euraxia's papers, Abnur Tharn appears to have uncovered something significant. I should talk to him."
"103224356-0-49217";"Euraxia's final order appears to concern an assassination squad and troops stationed at Sandswirl Manor to the west of the city. I should meet Abnur Tharn on the outskirts of the property."
"103224356-0-49218";"Tsazii won't abandon their farm while her husband Kinaro and her brother Hursh are still out in the fields. She suggested we might find them hiding in the hills to the west."
"103224356-0-49220";"We found Tsazii's husband and brother. Unfortunately, Euraxian soldiers killed her brother. Zamarak wants to stay behind to perform last rites. Now I need to return to the farmhouse and convince Tsazii to take her remaining family into town."

"103224356-0-49233";"The Desert Wind adept, Zamarak, has an idea on how we can disrupt Zumog Phoom's necromantic spell and return the dead to rest. He wants me to meet him at the temple in Riverhold."
"103224356-0-49234";"Zamarak needs to enter a peaceful, meditative state to memorize the ancient prayer that will activate the Moon Pillars around the town. I need to protect him from the attacking undead."

"103224356-0-49238";"The blessed Moon Pillars sanctified the town and took care of the undead problem, but now Dragons have arrived! I should observe what happens and wait for orders."
"103224356-0-49239";"Kaalgrontiid, Mulaamnir, and a third Dragon flew over the town. The two elder Dragons flew off, but the third Dragon has attacked. I should use the ballista to knock it to the ground so we can kill it."
"103224356-0-49240";"The ballista worked and the Dragon has been grounded! Now to attack it and kill it before it can once more take to the air."

"103224356-0-49252";"I agreed to help Tharn acquire this mysterious weapon. I should see what he needs me to do to accomplish that."
"103224356-0-49253";"The first of the moon-singer storytellers is Azargo Long-Tale. I can find him at the Redfur Trading Post in Grahtwood."
"103224356-0-49254";"Abnur Tharn arrived just as the moon-singer finished his story. I should talk to him and see if he can make sense of what we heard."
"103224356-0-49255";"Abnur Tharn believes that the moon-singer's story points to an Ayleid ruin in Grahtwood known as Wormroot Depths. I should enter the ruin and look for the clue the ancient Khajiiti left for us to find."
"103224356-0-49256";"A puzzle of light and prisms guards the triangulant that will help us decipher the map to the weapon. We need to solve the puzzle to gain the information."
"103224356-0-49257";"I solved the puzzle and revealed a chest. The triangulant we need should be inside. I should open the chest and take it."

"103224356-0-49261";"Another puzzle of light and prisms guards the triangulant that will help us decipher the map to the weapon. We need to solve the puzzle to gain the information."
"103224356-0-49262";"I solved the puzzle and revealed a chest. The triangulant we need should be inside. I should open the chest and take it."
"103224356-0-49263";"Tharn says our final clue will be found by listening to a storyteller in Rawl'kha, in Reaper's March. I should travel there now."
"103224356-0-49264";"The moon-singer finished her story. I should talk to Abnur Tharn and see if he can make sense of what we heard."
"103224356-0-49265";"Abnur Tharn believes that the moon-singer's story points to Jode's Light, a ruin here in Reaper's March. I should enter the ruin and look for the clue the ancient Khajiiti left for us to find."
"103224356-0-49266";"On the way to Jode's Light, a Khajiit stopped me. I should talk to her and see what she wants."
"103224356-0-49267";"Now that we're inside Jode's Light, I should talk to Abnur Tharn and tell him what Khamira told me about Euraxia Tharn, the Speaker of the Mane, and the ancient weapon."
"103224356-0-49268";"Regardless of whether I agree with Khamira or not, we need to find the ancient weapon before Euraxia Tharn does. To do that, we need to search Jode's Light and locate the final triangulant that will unlock the map."
"103224356-0-49269";"Another puzzle of light and prisms guards the final triangulant that will help us decipher the map to the weapon. We need to solve the puzzle to gain the information."
"103224356-0-49270";"I solved the puzzle and revealed a chest. The triangulant we need should be inside. I should open the chest and take it."
"103224356-0-49271";"Abnur Tharn opened a portal to his camp north of Cormount in Grahtwood. I should follow Tharn to his camp and see if the triangulants have helped him determine how to decipher the map."
"103224356-0-49272";"Khamira somehow tracked us to Tharn's camp. I should listen to what she has to say to Abnur Tharn."
"103224356-0-49273";"Khamira has decided to accompany us to the Halls of Colossus as we search for the ancient weapon. I should talk to Abnur Tharn and find out how he wants to proceed."
"103224356-0-49276";"I located Prefect Calo. He's locked in a cell. I should talk to him and get him to tell me about the Dragonguard and Euraxia's final order."
"103224356-0-49277";"I need to find Khamira and warn her about Cadwell's latest vision. He saw Zumog Phoom accompanying the Euraxians as they march toward Riverhold. They're bringing undead to attack the town!"
"103224356-0-49278";"As a sign of good faith, Prefect Calo told me I can find a copy of his report on the Dragonguard in his office upstairs. I should read it and learn what I can."
"103224356-0-49279";"It seems Prefect Calo was able to extract himself from his cell without my help after all. He wants to speak to me."
"103224356-0-49296";"I burned the cultists' oil supply, and took their enchanted tool, the Deadland Hammer. I should return to <<1>>  and collect my reward."
"103224356-0-49297";"I discovered Hadaz's body, and a hastily written letter, describing a Daedric plot that could put all of Elsweyr at risk. I must disrupt the cultists' plans by burning their oil and claiming their enchanted forging tool, the Deadland Hammer."
"103224356-0-49300";"I freed all the animals from the Bonechime Outpost. I should return to the ranch and speak to Numaia."
"103224356-0-49301";"I should destroy the Bonechime Gang's poaching camps and recover Numaia's Training Whistle."
"103224356-0-49302";"It looks like Abnur Tharn sent Zamarak to the Stitches to assist me. I should talk to him."
"103224356-0-49303";"I tracked the assassination squad to a door to an ancient Akaviri shrine. I should enter the shrine and try to find the so-called last Dragonguard before they kill him."
"103224356-0-49306";"Khamira was sent by the Speaker of the Mane to determine what Abnur Tharn's plans were regarding the ancient weapon. Khamira wants to help us find it before someone named Euraxia so she can destroy it. I should enter the ruin and consult with Abnur."
"103224356-0-49307";"I entered the ruins of Cicatrice. I should begin gathering diseased samples from the corpses in this area."
"103224356-0-49308";"I gathered the samples of diseased corpses. I should return to Iokkas."
"103224356-0-49311";"I need to enter the oasis caverns and find Iokkas' companions."
"103224356-0-49312";"I entered the caverns, and the antidote seems to be working. Now I need to search for Iokkas' companions."
"103224356-0-49314";"I found an Argonian near the entrance of the oasis. I should speak to her and see what's going on."
"103224356-0-49315";"Lara-Tan told me that there are many Khajiit still in the oasis, but they are too weak to leave. I need to deliver the antidote to them. I should also keep a look out for any research notes I might find."
"103224356-0-49316";"I found Iokkas. I should tell him that his companions are safe and that I found the research notes."
"103224356-0-49318";"Upon reading the research, Iokkas believes that a Nereid is spreading the corruption and causing corpses to come to life. In order to heal the oasis, I need to kill this Nereid."
"103224356-0-49323";"I saved Iokass' companions, found his egg-mother's research, and defeated a corrupt Nereid. I could speak to Iokkas about my reward."
"103224356-0-49325";"Abnur Tharn wants to know my opinion concerning Khamira's desire to destroy the ancient weapon. I should let him know what I think."
"103224356-0-49326";"Vazbi asked me to meet her at an aqueduct gate, not far from S'rendarr's Cradle."
"103224356-0-49327";"I should seek out Vazbi, a young adept who seems intent on resolving the water crisis at S'rendarr's Cradle."
"103224356-0-49328";"I should examine the aqueduct gate to see if I can discover what's stopped the flow of water to S'rendarr's Cradle."
"103224356-0-49330";"Vazbi asked me to meet her at a second span of the aqueduct, further along the line."
"103224356-0-49331";"I should examine the second aqueduct gate. Hopefully, I can discover what stopped the flow of water to S'rendarr's Cradle."
"103224356-0-49333";"Vazbi seems troubled. I should speak to her about the torn habit we found."
"103224356-0-49334";"After speaking with Vazbi, she's ready to proceed. We should enter Baan Dar's Litter and continue our search for the injured stranger."
"103224356-0-49335";"Vazbi caught a glimpse of someone she doesn't recognize, wearing the robes of a S'rendarr's Cradle healer. It may be the stranger we've been tracking. We should try to catch up and ask this person if they know anything about the water crisis."
"103224356-0-49336";"A group of plague-scarred Khajiit attacked me. I must fight my way through this ambush."
"103224356-0-49337";"The Stricken's leader, Hulzar, took Vazbi deeper into Baan Dar's Litter. I should pursue them."
"103224356-0-49338";"I found Silhu-jo, Vazbi's superior, looking for us in Baan Dar's Litter. I should let him know what's happened to Vazbi."
"103224356-0-49339";"Silhu-jo says he has a plan to free Vazbi from the Stricken. He needs me to escort him to the Baan Dar Span—the Stricken's main encampment."
"103224356-0-49340";"Silhu-jo wants to talk to me before we enter the Baan Dar Span. I should see what he wants."
"103224356-0-49341";"Silhu-jo is appealing to Hulzar and the Stricken to release Vazbi and abandon their plan to destroy the adeptorium. I should catch up."
"103224356-0-49342";"Hulzar, clearly driven by grief and rage, killed Silhu-jo and fled. I need to kill him before he destroys S'rendarr's Cradle."
"103224356-0-49343";"I should talk to Vazbi and make sure she's unharmed after being kidnapped by Hulzar."
"103224356-0-49344";"I should open the sluice gate and return the flow of water to the adeptorium."
"103224356-0-49345";"I should return to the adeptorium now that the flow of water has been restored."
"103224356-0-49346";"After all she went through in Baan Dar's Litter, Vazbi is struggling with a crisis of faith. I should see if there's anything I can do to help her."
"103224356-0-49347";"I convinced Vazbi to remain at S'rendarr's Cradle. I should speak with her to conclude our business."
"103224356-0-49348";"I convinced Vazbi to leave S'rendarr's Cradle. I should speak with her to conclude our business."
"103224356-0-49349";"I should search the ancient Akaviri shrine to find any sign of the Dragonguard or the assassination squad."
"103224356-0-49350";"I should continue looking for this injured stranger in Baan Dar's Litter."
"103224356-0-49354";"An ancient structure hidden in this cave features a massive door, but it appears to be sealed by some sort of magical barrier. Zamarak thinks the stone pedestal in front of the door might provide a way to open it. I should examine the pedestal."
"103224356-0-49355";"We heard the assassination squad shouting from deeper within this underground complex. I should search the passages and try to find them."
"103224356-0-49358";"I heard Captain Saulinia call out from nearby. I need to find her before she reaches the Dragonguard."
"103224356-0-49359";"I finally caught up to Captain Saulinia, the leader of the Euraxian assassination squad. I need to stop her."
"103224356-0-49360";"I destroyed the Bonechime Gang's poacher camps and recovered the Training Whistle. I should deliver it to Numaia."
"103224356-0-49362";"The wounded Dragonguard ran off. I should follow him and find out if he's all right."
"103224356-0-49363";"Dragonguard Orland gave me his signet ring. He said it would open the Dragonguard Sanctuary. I need to enter the sanctuary and find the Dragonhorn."
"103224356-0-49364";"Now that the barrier is down, I should enter the sanctuary and claim the Dragonhorn."
"103224356-0-49365";"Now that I have the Dragonhorn, I should return to Rimmen Palace and report to Khamira and Abnur Tharn."
"103224356-0-49367";"The Bonechime poachers attacked the ranch while I was raiding their camps in the Prowl. They seized Numaia's animals and dragged them off to their primary encampment. I need to rescue these beasts and kill the poachers' leader, Rahti the Peeler."
"103224356-0-49372";"Abnur Tharn suggests that a small strike team stands the best chance of getting into the Rimmen Palace to deal with Euraxia. Gharesh-ri might have an idea on how to get inside. I should speak to him."
"103224356-0-49373";"Euraxia the Usurper Queen has been dethroned. Though reeling from recent events, Khamira has claimed her birthright to lead the Anequine Khajiit. But the necromancers and the Dragons remain to threaten the land. I should talk to Khamira."
"103224356-0-49374";"Now that I finished with Cadwell, I should head into the palace and go to the throne room to attend the meeting of the war council."
"103224356-0-49376";"The Betrayer is dead, but not before he started an eclipse that will shortly open the Moon Gate of Anequina and allow the Dragons to reach Jode's Core. I should consult with Khamira about our next course of action."
"103224356-0-49382";"Iokkas has completed his antidote. I should drink it so that I won't be infected by the toxic gas within the oasis."
"103224356-0-49393";"The old castellan, Aneshi, cares for a shrine to Khunzar-ri located southeast of Riverhold. I should go to the shrine and try to find him."
"103224356-0-49395";"If I use Numaia's training whistle, Marmalade will probably help me open the Outpost Gate."
"103224356-0-49396";"I found Aneshi, the former castellan of Rimmen Palace. I should talk to him and see if he knows a way we can get into the palace without being seen."
"103224356-0-49397";"Aneshi hid the master key near ruins to the west. I should follow the directions he wrote down and acquire the master key."
"103224356-0-49402";"Abnur Tharn arranged a chartered wagon and boat to take us to the Halls of Colossus. I should find the wagon outside Cormount in Grahtwood when I'm ready to depart."
"103224356-0-49403";"The chartered wagon took us to a boat, which took us to a remote stretch of beach along the southern coast of Elsweyr. The ruins of the Halls of Colossus are just ahead. We need to enter the ruins and locate the weapon."
"103224356-0-49404";"The Halls of Colossus appear ancient and are filled with statuary and ruins. I should help Tharn and Khamira search for some way to get deeper inside."
"103224356-0-49405";"Captain Calsivius, an Imperial in service to Euraxia Tharn, flooded the chamber with poison gas and sent a horde of undead to attack us. I need to deal with the undead while Abnur Tharn keeps the gas at bay."
"103224356-0-49406";"With the undead defeated and the gas trap foiled, now we need to solve the puzzle to open the interior door. Only then can we chase after Captain Calsivius and beat him to the weapon."
"103224356-0-49407";"The door leading into the interior of the Halls of Colossus is open. Now to reach Captain Calsivius and stop him from attaining the weapon before we do."
"103224356-0-49408";"To continue our pursuit of Captain Calsivius, I need to solve another Khajiiti light puzzle. This one appears more complex than any of the previous puzzles I dealt with."
"103224356-0-49409";"The door is open. Now to reach Captain Calsivius before he reaches the weapon."
"103224356-0-49410";"We were wrong. The legend isn't about a weapon—it's about Dragons! I have to stop Captain Calsivius before he unleashes the trapped Dragons."
"103224356-0-49411";"I killed Captain Calsivius, but the vault is almost open. I need to protect Abnur Tharn while he attempts to stop the process and reseal the vault."
"103224356-0-49412";"Too late! The vault has opened and the Dragons are escaping! I need to get out of their way."
"103224356-0-49413";"The Dragons escaped from their ancient prison and there's nothing else to be done here. Tharn opened a portal to take us out of the Halls of Colossus. I should use it."
"103224356-0-49414";"We returned from the Halls of Colossus, but weren't able to stop the Dragons from escaping their ancient prison. I should speak to Khamira and see what she thinks of the situation."
"103224356-0-49415";"Khamira is worried about what the Dragons will do now that they are loose in Elsweyr. I should talk to Abnur Tharn and see if he has any ideas on how to rectify the situation."
"103224356-0-49416";"Abnur Tharn admitted that his half-sister Euraxia tricked him into following the clues and releasing the Dragons into Elsweyr. I should find out if he has a plan for rectifying the situation."
"103224356-0-49418";"Khamira asked me to talk to Abnur Tharn and see if he knows where I need to go to find the necromancer, Zumog Phoom."
"103224356-0-49423";"Marmalade plucked the key off the drunken guard and dropped it down for me. I should pick it up."
"103224356-0-49424";"I have the key to Rahti's Command Post. I should use it to enter the innermost section of the Bonechime Outpost."
"103224356-0-49426";"I found Numaia's prized senche lion, Milksop. I should set him free."
"103224356-0-49428";"Abnur Tharn was able to identify the location Cadwell teleported to. It's an ancient crypt in the Scar, not far from the Stitches. I need to head there and meet up with Tharn and the rest of my companions."
"103224356-0-49429";"Another locked gate lies between me and Numaia's prized senche lion, Milksop. A drunken guard almost certainly holds the key. I should call for Marmalade again. She might be able to help."
"103224356-0-49439";"The strike force is gathering near the wall just outside Rimmen. Now that I have the master key, I should go and meet them there."
"103224356-0-49440";"I rendezvoused with Abnur Tharn and the rest of the strike force outside the walls of Rimmen. I should talk to him to find out about our next move."
"103224356-0-49441";"After Captain Nala-do deals with the Euraxian guarding the gate, I need to enter the south weapons platform and destroy the siege weapons aimed into the city."
"103224356-0-49446";"Now that the siege weapons have been destroyed, I should rendezvous with the rest of the strike force at the sewer entrance."
"103224356-0-49447";"The master key that Aneshi provided should open the door to the crypts. From there, we can search the crypts and find a way to enter the palace. Then we can meet up with the rest of the strike force."
"103224356-0-49448";"I should speak to Captain Nala-do before we head into the sewers to find the door to the crypts."
"103224356-0-49450";"Zamarak says that the crypt for the royal family has been disturbed. I should investigate."
"103224356-0-49451";"I should speak to Zamarak and see what he thinks happened to the royal graves."
"103224356-0-49454";"Now that we're inside the palace, we need to locate Khamira and the other members of the strike force."
"103224356-0-49456";"Zamarak says that we need to go to the Chapel of the Guiding Moons. From there, we can go through the Great Hall to reach the Royal Chambers."
"103224356-0-49457";"The necromancer Zumog Phoom trapped us in the chapel with a horde of undead. I need to protect Zamarak while he creates an exit out of here."
"103224356-0-49458";"Cadwell is free. Now I need to get to the Royal Chambers and confront Euraxia."
"103224356-0-49460";"The Dragons and the necromancers have deserted Euraxia Tharn. This is our chance to defeat the Usurper Queen and free Rimmen."
"103224356-0-49461";"Euraxia has been defeated, but at what cost? Captain Nala-do fell in the battle and Khamira had to watch her parents die again. She ordered us to go to the throne room. I should make sure she's all right."
"103224356-0-49462";"We gathered inside the palace throne room after defeating Euraxia. I should talk to Khamira now."
"103224356-0-49468";"I should introduce myself to Magnate Feina-Darak and see what information I can find out from her. I can find her in Hakoshae's town square."
"103224356-0-49469";"While exiting the tomb, Ashur told me to meet him in Hakoshae's town square. I should speak to him and collect my reward."
"103224356-0-49472";"I need to enter Zumog Phoom's lair and prevent him from reanimating Cadwell the Betrayer."
"103224356-0-49473";"Zumog Phoom stole energy from Cadwell and has deposited it at various ritual sites throughout his lair. I need to help Cadwell recover that energy."
"103224356-0-49476";"We found Cadwell inside Zumog Phoom's lair. I should talk to him."
"103224356-0-49477";"Zamarak will stay behind to guard our rear while Captain Nala-do and I reach the Great Hall. From there, we can enter the Royal Chambers and confront Euraxia."
"103224356-0-49478";"Abnur Tharn and Khamira entered the palace courtyard to eavesdrop on Euraxia and the Dragon Mulaamnir. I should follow them."
"103224356-0-49480";"I was told that I can find Tasnasi on the outskirts of the Stitches. I should speak to her about this job she's recruiting for."
"103224356-0-49481";"Tasnasi asked me to recruit three other people to join her crew: Vole the mechanist at Jubani's Junkshop, Sereyne the mage by the Goiter's Gulp, and Nazdar the adept on the western outskirts of town."
"103224356-0-49482";"Tasnasi told me that Vole recently did a job for Jubani and said I should find him near Jubani's Junkshop."
"103224356-0-49483";"Jubani's thugs have taken Vole and are keeping him captive in the junkshop. I need to get inside without stirring up trouble."
"103224356-0-49484";"I made it inside Jubani's Junkshop. Now I need to find Vole and rescue him from Jubani's thugs."
"103224356-0-49485";"I freed Vole from his bonds and allowed for his escape. I should talk to Vole outside Jubani's Junkshop and convince him to join Tasnasi's crew."
"103224356-0-49487";"I found Sereyne passed out near the tavern. I need to find a way to wake her."
"103224356-0-49488";"Sereyne's not pleased about her rude awakening, but hopefully I can convince her to join Tasnasi's crew."
"103224356-0-49489";"Sereyne needs me to get her arcane focus, which she pawned to two pawnbrokers, Scipion and Iulius Averno. I can find them in the Goiter's Gulp."
"103224356-0-49490";"I have Sereyne's arcane focus. I should bring it to her so she'll agree to join Tasnasi's crew."
"103224356-0-49492";"I should search the Stitches for Nazdar."
"103224356-0-49493";"I found Nazdar staring off into the canyon. I should talk to him about joining Tasnasi's crew."
"103224356-0-49494";"Nazdar is preoccupied with the loss of a prized possession of his: a lute gifted to him by a late friend. I agreed to retrieve his lute from where he left it when hostile beasts chased him off."
"103224356-0-49495";"I found Nazdar's lute. I should bring it to him and see if he's more receptive to joining Tasnasi's crew."
"103224356-0-49497";"Tasnasi and the rest of her crew are all accounted for. I should speak to her and learn more about the job she's planning."
"103224356-0-49498";"I should listen while Tasnasi goes over her plan to break into the vault in Meirvale Keep."
"103224356-0-49499";"Now that everyone has agreed to join Tasnasi's crew, I should meet them at the Bowel, a small cave at the base of Meirvale Keep."
"103224356-0-49500";"Tasnasi said we can enter Meirvale Keep through the dungeons beneath the fortress. We can climb up into them through the Bowel."
"103224356-0-49501";"I need to work with Vole to unlock the Dwemer locks sealing off the dungeon, so we can  make our way to the courtyard of Meirvale Keep."
"103224356-0-49502";"Now that we've made it to the courtyard, Sereyne is responsible for transporting the crew across the open area without being seen. I should wait for her to complete her spell."
"103224356-0-49503";"Sereyne's spell has gone awry. Nazdar and I have been separated from the group, but Sereyne is trying to communicate through some kind of projection.  I should speak to her to discuss how to proceed."
"103224356-0-49504";"Sereyne doesn't have the power to attempt to teleport us back to the group. Nazdar and I will need to make our way across Meirvale Keep's courtyard by stealth."
"103224356-0-49505";"Now that we successfully reunited with the rest of the crew, Nazdar is going to scale the wall of Meirvale Keep and tie off a rope to allow us to follow him into the tower."
"103224356-0-49506";"I should use the rope ladder Nazdar dropped to enter Meirvale Keep."
"103224356-0-49507";"We made it inside the keep, but Nazdar suffered some injury from his climb. I should talk to Tasnasi to go over the next step of the plan."
"103224356-0-49508";"Tasnasi asked Sereyne and I to find the three keys to open Khasda's vault. They should be somewhere within the palace."
"103224356-0-49509";"I found all of Khasda's vault keys. I should meet Tasnasi at the vault, deeper in the Meirvale Keep palace."
"103224356-0-49510";"Nazdar and Vole came to find me after hearing that Tasnasi has been captured by Khasda. I need to find her and rescue her before Khasda kills her."
"103224356-0-49512";"Khasda has ordered his minotaur enforcer, Cud, to dispatch me. I'll need to kill him to save Tasnasi."
"103224356-0-49513";"Tasnasi has Khasda cornered. I should see what she intends to do with him."
"103224356-0-49517";"I convinced Tasnasi not to kill Khasda. She's agreed to see that he confesses to his crimes before the Stitches and told me to meet with her and the crew at the Goiter's Gulp tavern."
"103224356-0-49518";"Tasnasi decided to kill Khasda for his crimes against her and Dashing Dasalzo. She told me to meet her back at her camp outside of the Stitches to conclude our business."
"103224356-0-49519";"Sereyne told me that Tasnasi wants me to avoid killing any of the guards while I cross the courtyard."
"103224356-0-49522";"Magnate Feina-Darak has allowed me to join her festival. This might be a good opportunity to investigate her background. I'll need to first speak to Domitia Nasica."
"103224356-0-49523";"In order to complete the Proof of Reverence, I must place a paper lotus into the river. This will notify my ancestors that I am participating in the festival."
"103224356-0-49527";"I should talk to Vek-Drassi Secunia in order to start the Proof of Strength."
"103224356-0-49528";"I should talk to Valoria Marius in order to start the Proof of Wisdom."
"103224356-0-49532";"Captain Nala-do's spirit is waiting to talk to me. I should speak with her."
"103224356-0-49533";"I disrupted each of the ritual sites except for the main one. Now I need to stop Zumog Phoom before he completes the ritual."
"103224356-0-49542";"I need to collect a nearby flower that grows in a senche-lion lair."
"103224356-0-49543";"I have the flower. I should return to Vek-Drassi Secunia."
"103224356-0-49544";"I killed Zumog Phoom, but not before he completed his ritual. Now Cadwell the Betrayer has been made whole!"
"103224356-0-49546";"Cadwell the Betrayer opened a portal and disappeared. I should talk to the Cadwell I know and find out why he seems so weak again."
"103224356-0-49547";"Cadwell faded away, but not before telling me what he knows of the Betrayer's plans. I need to return to Rimmen Palace and tell my companions what's going on."
"103224356-0-49548";"A priest named Haduras warned of the strange goings on at the temple and requested my help. We crossed paths as he was pursuing another priest, Zargha, chasing a beast's young, and asked me to retrieve him before he's hurt."
"103224356-0-49549";"I saved Zargha from the terror bird. Haduras will want to know that he's safe."
"103224356-0-49550";"I saved Zargha from the beast and he was quick to return to the temple, but his rescue piqued the interest of a strange cat who appeared out of thin air. I should speak to this mysterious spectator."
"103224356-0-49551";"I must solve the riddle by bringing Valoria the correct item."
"103224356-0-49552";"I have the item. I should return to Valoria Marius."
"103224356-0-49553";"I need to tell Khamira what happened at Zumog Phoom's lair and what Cadwell told me about the Betrayer's plans."
"103224356-0-49554";"I found Haduras trying to reason with some priests from his temple who are on some deranged errand of self-harm. I should see if he needs my help."
"103224356-0-49556";"Mizzik wants to check if Ishu remembers any other details about our investigation. I should head to Ishu's home."
"103224356-0-49557";"Ishu suggested I speak to Mell the Musical, a singing Wood Elf who tends to stay up late and may have seen something the night of the abduction. I can find her in the northern part of town, near the sand gardens."
"103224356-0-49558";"I found Mell the Musical in the sand gardens. I should speak to her."
"103224356-0-49560";"Though Mell didn't see anything the night of the abduction, she has noticed that the gambler Tajirri has been rather suspicious lately. She suggested I search behind the local stables."
"103224356-0-49561";"I helped Mizzik rescue Zinthia and take down a smuggling operation. I should speak to him about my reward."
"103224356-0-49562";"Khamira wants us to gather in the royal study so she can show us something."
"103224356-0-49563";"Khamira has something to tell us. I should listen to what she has to say."
"103224356-0-49564";"Khamira's pendant identified a location on the map of Elsweyr: The Shadow Dance Ruins. I should talk to her and see if she thinks that was what Cadwell was trying to tell us."
"103224356-0-49565";"Haduras asked me to head to a nearby campsite emanating the scent of roasted meat in search of a strange iron fork that smells of roast beef, so his fellow priests can't blind themselves with it. I should head there now."
"103224356-0-49566";"I completed the Three Proofs. I should share what I learned with Ashur."
"103224356-0-49567";"I should talk to the guard to distract him."
"103224356-0-49568";"Lyrrsazhi brought me a message. Abnur Tharn and the war council await my presence in K'har Zhab Hall in Riverhold. I should go and see what Abnur Tharn has to say."
"103224356-0-49570";"Ashur wants to steal a key from a town guard. I need to distract a guard by talking to him."
"103224356-0-49571";"We think the Betrayer is on his way to the ruins of the Shadow Dance Temple. I need to get there as soon as I can."
"103224356-0-49572";"I entered the Shadow Dance Ruins. I should talk to Khamira and see if she knows how to proceed."
"103224356-0-49573";"Khamira opened a path into the depths of the ruined temple. I should follow her."
"103224356-0-49574";"Ashur was able to steal a key. We should enter the magnate's cellar."
"103224356-0-49575";"A door in the cellar has a magical barrier. I should look around to see if I can find a way to take it down."
"103224356-0-49576";"I found an Akaviri fable and four tablets.The tablets look like they can fit in nearby sockets. I should try placing the tablets."
"103224356-0-49577";"The magical barrier protecting the door is down. I should enter the chamber."
"103224356-0-49578";"There's a letter inside the chamber. I should read it."
"103224356-0-49579";"The magnate has found us in her cellar. I should listen to her."
"103224356-0-49580";"The portal opened by Khamira led to an underground temple. I need to look around and see if I can find any sign of the Betrayer."
"103224356-0-49582";"I found another temple relic. I need to activate it to help Khamira continue the process of attunement to the Lunar Lattice."
"103224356-0-49583";"The temple relic started the process of attuning Khamira to the Lunar Lattice. She needs to complete the process in order to stop the Betrayer from moving the moons and opening the way to Jode's Core. I should help her find the remaining relics."
"103224356-0-49584";"Now that Khamira has been attuned, we need to reach the temple sanctuary and stop the Betrayer from causing the moons to move and form an eclipse."
"103224356-0-49585";"As soon as I'm ready, I need to enter the temple sanctuary and confront Cadwell the Betrayer."
"103224356-0-49586";"I reached the temple sanctuary and located Cadwell the Betrayer. Now I have to confront him and end his evil existence."
"103224356-0-49587";"I killed the Betrayer, but Khamira seems to be having a problem reversing the eclipse. I should talk to her."
"103224356-0-49588";"I need to watch as Khamira absorbs the energy from the temple relic. She thinks she can use it to restore the power of the Dragonhorn of Anequina."
"103224356-0-49590";"Khamira wants us to return to Rimmen Palace and gather our forces before we decide what to do about the eclipse that the Betrayer set in motion."
"103224356-0-49606";"Khamira wants to discuss a plan for confronting the Betrayer before we enter the sanctuary."
"103224356-0-49608";"The magnate was abducted by an Akaviri spirit. I should speak to Ashur about what just occurred."
"103224356-0-49609";"I should head inside the Hakoshae tombs in order to find Magnate Feina-Darak."
"103224356-0-49611";"I need to find the magnate. She should be somewhere inside the tombs."
"103224356-0-49612";"There's a a guardian spirit blocking the door. I should kill the spirit so I can advance."
"103224356-0-49613";"I killed the guardian spirit. I should head inside the founder chamber and continue my search for the magnate."
"103224356-0-49614";"It turns out that the Akaviri spirit is Proconsul Beloren-Kaie. I should speak with him and see what's going on."
"103224356-0-49615";"It turns out that the magnate is not a descendant of the Potentate. I should talk to her about the proconsul's ultimatum."
"103224356-0-49619";"The mysterious stranger was a talking cat who seems to be responsible for the strange events at the temple. He's challenged me to join his game and told me that the priests are about to maim themselves. I should try to reach the temple and stop them."
"103224356-0-49621";"The unusual cat I encountered before was revealed to be the Skooma Cat, another identity of the Daedric Prince of Madness. He has reappeared and wants to talk to me."
"103224356-0-49629";"It appears that a camp has been set up near the Sleeping Badger. We should proceed cautiously."
"103224356-0-49630";"I searched the stables and found what appears to be a clue. I should speak to Mizzik and see if he knows more."
"103224356-0-49631";"I should bring the Akaviri relics to Kiseravi and collect my reward."
"103224356-0-49632";"I should enter the Tomb of the Serpents and gather the Akaviri relics."
"103224356-0-49637";"Mizzik deduced that the note I found refers to a rock formation called the Sleeping Badger. I should head south toward the formation with Mizzik."
"103224356-0-49643";"The Skooma Cat has been toying with the priests of the Two Moons at Tenmar Temple, much to their detriment. He told me that he's been having them jump off the temple and said that the Moon-Bishop is about to take the leap next. I need to stop her."
"103224356-0-49644";"One of the priests in the courtyard is shouting encouragement to a figure up on the temple's balcony. She may know what's going on."
"103224356-0-49645";"I spoke to Sizenza, but was interrupted by the Skooma Cat who vanished her. I should try to find out what he's done to her."
"103224356-0-49646";"I found the anchor, but the Skooma Cat has left a bizarre protector behind to prevent me from reaching it. I'll need to destroy it."
"103224356-0-49649";"Now that I reached the anchor, the Skooma Cat changed back into Sheogorath to greet me. Some sort of magical barrier surrounds the anchor, so I may have no choice but to speak to the Mad God."
"103224356-0-49660";"I found skooma and a small golden necklace. I should speak to Mizzik about these new clues."
"103224356-0-49661";"Mizzik believes that smugglers have abducted Zinthia and that Tajirri may know more. It's likely we'll find Tajirri in the Banished Regrets. I should head there."
"103224356-0-49662";"A Khajiit has called out to me. I should speak to her and see what she wants."
"103224356-0-49663";"Rideza warned me to stop my investigation, stating that Ishu's daughter left town years ago. I should let Mizzik know what I was just told."
"103224356-0-49664";"Mizzik believes that the gambler Tajirri may have more information about Zinthia's abduction. I should search her lodgings while Mizzik distracts her."
"103224356-0-49665";"I found a mysterious note in Tajirri's home. I should show it to Mizzik."
"103224356-0-49666";"Mizzik deduced that the note likely describes smuggler caches. I should search for marked barrels or crates to find more clues about the investigation."
"103224356-0-49671";"Ishu seems baffled as to why smugglers are targeting him and Zinthia. With no new leads, I should head back to Mizzik to further discuss the investigation."
"103224356-0-49674";"I found Rideza, the Khajiit I met earlier, threatening Mizzik. I should speak to her and see what she wants."
"103224356-0-49675";"I need to follow Rideza's trail. Hopefully, she'll lead me straight to Zinthia."
"103224356-0-49680";"Rideza's jelly footprints led me to a trapdoor. I should enter it."
"103224356-0-49681";"Rideza's smugglers have proven themselves a vicious crew. I should be prepared to defend myself."
"103224356-0-49683";"It turns out that Rideza was actually Ishu's blood daughter, and stole her father's prize pet Zinthia out of spite. I should speak to Mizzik."
"103224356-0-49685";"I killed the three master hunters and the gryphon, Quillmane. I should find Sarazi and inform him of my success."
"103224356-0-49686";"I should track down and kill the gryphon and these reclusive hunters."
"103224356-0-49691";"Rideza threatened me before quickly vanishing. I should speak to Mizzik about what just happened."
"103224356-0-49696";"I should find Tahara, the proprietor of the traveling menagerie."
"103224356-0-49697";"Burtle, the ""slavering beast"" that escaped from Tahara's menagerie, is loose somewhere in Rimmen. I must find it before it escapes for good."
"103224356-0-49698";"I found the ""monster,"" Burtle, hiding near the market. Unfortunately, he refuses to budge. I need to find a way to lure him out."
"103224356-0-49699";"I managed to coax Burtle out of hiding. Now I should lead him back to his owner, Tahara."
"103224356-0-49700";"If I crouch down, I should be able to find signs of the beast's passage."
"103224356-0-49702";"Burtle looks hungry. Perhaps I can find some food to lure him out."
"103224356-0-49706";"We defeated Mulaamnir and stopped Kaalgrontiid from stealing all of the energy stored in Jode's Core by ending the eclipse. I should talk to Khamira about what happens next."
"103224356-0-49707";"Yushiha was able to protect a Khajiiti traveler from Rakazsa, another vampire of her clan, but fears that others passing through the Weeping Scar won't be so lucky. She asked me to check the traveler's nearby camp."
"103224356-0-49708";"Rakazsa is dead and the caravanners are rescued. I should talk to Yushiha about what's transpired."
"103224356-0-49709";"I freed Mazdurr and recovered his amulet of Azurah. I should speak to him about my reward."
"103224356-0-49710";"I need to find a key to Mazdurr's cage to help him escape. I should also recover his amulet of Azurah, which should be near the bandit's leader, Zayreba Sharpclaw."
"103224356-0-49715";"Now that I gathered both the key and amulet, I should unlock Mazdurr's cage."
"103224356-0-49716";"I can kill Daedra anywhere, but concentrations exist at the Brothers of Strife in Stonefalls, Torinaan in Auridon, and the Moonlit Maw in Stormhaven."
"103224356-0-49717";"I filled all the soul gems Zahari gave me with Daedric souls. I should return to her camp and deliver the filled soul gems."
"103224356-0-49722";"Tasnasi told me I should be able to find Sereyne in or near the Goiter's Gulp, a tavern in the Stitches."
"103224356-0-49723";"I found no survivors at the camp, but they left behind journal indicating that they fell behind a caravan headed through the area. I should search for the caravan and warn them about the vampires."
"103224356-0-49724";"I found the caravan empty except for Rakazsa. It appears he wants to talk. I'll listen, for now."
"103224356-0-49727";"Khamira asked me to find our companions in Rimmen and tell them the time has come to assemble at the Moon Gate of Anequina. I need to talk to Abnur Tharn, Zamarak, Prefect Calo, and Cadwell."
"103224356-0-49730";"Now I have to meet up with Khamira and the rest of my companions at the Moon Gate of Anequina, which is located in the southwest portion of the region."
"103224356-0-49731";"Rakazsa blames his late Clan Mother's pacifist ways for decades of deprivation and suffering. It seemed like he had more to say on the matter, but Yushiha chased him off. I should speak to her."
"103224356-0-49732";"I found the key to the makeshift kennels the vampires are keeping the caravanners captive in. I should use it to rescue whoever I can find."
"103224356-0-49733";"I should look for Hadaz inside Darkpool Mine."
"103224356-0-49736";"I reached the base of the Moon Gate. Gharesh-ri ordered me to report to Prefect Calo. I should talk to Calo and see what he needs me to do."
"103224356-0-49738";"The Dragons have started their attack! Prefect Calo ordered me to ascend to the Moon Gate and assist Queen Khamira in any way I can."
"103224356-0-49739";"A Dragon attack just targeted Gharesh-ri! I should talk to Zamarak so we can assess the situation."
"103224356-0-49740";"Zamarak decided to stay behind to lead the troops. I need to continue to climb toward the Moon Gate and join up with Abnur Tharn and Khamira."
"103224356-0-49741";"While Khamira tries to close the Moon Gate, I need to fend off the attacking Euraxians."
"103224356-0-49743";"Khamira wasn't able to close the Moon Gate before the Dragons Mulaamnir and Kaalgrontiid barreled through the portal. Now we need to follow them and stop them from reaching the power at Jode's Core."
"103224356-0-49744";"Khamira remembers this place from the memories she gained during her attunement. I need to accompany her to Jode's Core and help her figure out a way to stop the Dragons."
"103224356-0-49749";"The dead are rising all over town. I need to help Captain Nala-do deal with the group Zumog Phoom sent against us."
"103224356-0-49754";"Kaalgrontiid has begun the process of withdrawing the power from Jode's Core. Before we can deal with him, however, Mulaamnir stands in our way. I need to find a way to defeat Mulaamnir."
"103224356-0-49755";"Mulaamnir is dead, but Kaalgrontiid continues to absorb power from Jode's Core. I need to wait for Khamira to complete her ritual in case she requires my help."
"103224356-0-49756";"Cadwell appeared and opened a portal to take us back to Elsweyr. I should use the portal now."
"103224356-0-49758";"Cadwell's portal returned us to Rimmen. I should talk to Khamira and make sure she's all right after everything that occurred in the Plane of Jode."
"103224356-0-49759";"Iraya has returned. I should let her know what happened."
"103224356-0-49760";"The jewel worked and the museum is filled with the sound of the ancient Khajiiti song. No doubt this will help Iraya and Izanji attract more visitors to the House of Histories. I should check in with Iraya now."
"103224356-0-49761";"We escaped Star Haven. Ma'jha-dro wants to speak with me."
"103224356-0-49762";"The spirit told us that an ancient lich called Arum-Khal has awakened beneath the Ashen Scar. I should talk to Vastarie and see if I can help further."
"103224356-0-49763";"The Moonlight Blade will help me defeat Arum-Khal, but age has weakened the enchantments that the Hidden Moon adepts placed on it. I should ask Vastarie if she can help, while also filling her in on the progress I've made."
"103224356-0-49764";"We restored Shando-ri's soul and also managed to redeem his fallen brother, Arum-Khal. I should discuss all that's happened with Vastarie."
"103224356-0-49771";"I freed the caravanners. Now I need to find Rakazsa and put an end to his attacks."
"103224356-0-49772";"Yushiha could not convince Rakazsa to give up and is convinced he will not stop his bloody hunt until he is dead. She asked me to kill him and put an end to this."
"103224356-0-49773";"Rakazsa awaits me in his den. I need to kill him to free Yushiha's clan from his influence."
"103224356-0-49774";"Vastarie believes she can locate the source of the undead corruption if I place three of her descrying stones in the Ashen Scar."
"103224356-0-49775";"Placing the descrying stones helped Vastarie pinpoint a concentration of necromantic energy in a tomb at the center of the Ashen Scar. I should investigate the place."
"103224356-0-49776";"I should find Rakhzargo and see what work he has for me."
"103224356-0-49777";"I should talk to Rakhzargo's mother, Kideya, and see what I can learn about these missing farmhands. I can find her at Sweetwater Farmstead."
"103224356-0-49778";"Kideya asked me to look for her missing farmhands. She told me to enlist the help of her oldest son, who's lounging around nearby. I should find him."
"103224356-0-49779";"I found Kideya's son, Razum-dar, lounging nearby. I should talk to him about the missing farmhands."
"103224356-0-49780";"Raz suggests we search the nearby moon-sugar farm, Fragrant Moons Planation, to see if they're somehow involved in the missing farmhands."
"103224356-0-49781";"I  should speak to Razaum-dar about our infiltration of Fragrant Moons Plantation."
"103224356-0-49782";"I need to make my way inside Fragrant Moons Plantation. I should be careful, since they don't tolerate trespassers."
"103224356-0-49783";"I should search Fragrant Moons Plantation to find out what I can about the missing farmhands."
"103224356-0-49786";"I should talk to Razum-dar about what we learned at Fragrant Moons Plantation."
"103224356-0-49787";"Razum-dar wants us to investigate Honey-Breeze Homestead, another of Merryvale's moon-sugar farms. I should head there now."
"103224356-0-49788";"A monster has attacked Honey-Breeze Homestead, causing the local animals to become aggressive. I should make sure J'dathal is safe and see if he has more information."
"103224356-0-49789";"The monster that attacked Honey-Breeze Homestead has made its way toward a nearby cave. I should track it down and kill it."
"103224356-0-49790";"I found the daedroth that's been terrorizing Honey-Breeze Homestead. I should kill it."
"103224356-0-49791";"I should talk to Razum-dar about what happened at Honey-Breeze Homestead."
"103224356-0-49792";"Razum-dar wants to investigate the storage cellars of Sweetwater Farmstead. I should meet him there."
"103224356-0-49793";"Razum-dar suspects there will be signs of theft in his mother's storage cellar. I should start searching."
"103224356-0-49794";"It seems that a tapestry has been hung up in the cellar without Kideya's knowledge. I should examine it."
"103224356-0-49797";"I discovered a tunnel that leads directly into Kideya's storage cellar. I should investigate and see where it goes."
"103224356-0-49798";"The tunnel led to a complex of caverns beneath Merryvale. I should investigate and see if there are any signs of the moon-sugar thieves."
"103224356-0-49801";"I found a tied-up woman. I should speak to her and see if she has any information about what's going on."
"103224356-0-49802";"I learned the criminals are a skooma ring run by a mage named Saevus. I should kill him and stop their operation."
"103224356-0-49803";"I stopped the skooma ring. I should meet Razum-dar back at Sweetwater Farmstead."
"103224356-0-49804";"I stopped the skooma ring. I should talk to Razum-dar about my reward."
"103224356-0-49805";"I gathered Marzula-jo's notes and memory stones. I should deliver them to Narama-ko and claim my reward."
"103224356-0-49806";"I should search the Abode of Ignominy for Marzula-jo's notes and memory stones."
"103224356-0-49811";"I entered the Plane of Jode. I should talk to Khamira and find out why she didn't want me to use the Dragonhorn."
"103224356-0-49822";"An evil Khajiiti spirit appeared when I destroyed the orb. I should talk to Vastarie about what just occurred."
"103224356-0-49823";"We found a body sprawled beside the dark lich's orb. Vastarie intends to conduct a summoning ritual to find out what this dead Khajiit knows. I need to place one of her descrying stones in the center of the tomb so she can begin."
"103224356-0-49824";"Vastarie's ritual worked and a Khajiiti spirit hovers before us. I should question it."
"103224356-0-49829";"I need to craft the furnishings specified by my contract.\n\nOnce I've crafted them, I need to deliver them to any writ turn-in site."
"103224356-0-49830";"I've placed the requested furnishings into the crate. All that remains is to sign the manifest."
"103224356-0-49838";"Queen Khamira seems to have one more thing to say to me. I should talk to her."
"103224356-0-49841";"It appears that the forces that defended the Moon Gate have returned to the city. I should speak to Gharesh-ri, Zamarak, and Prefect Calo and find out what happened after we entered the Moon Gate."
"103224356-0-49843";"I should find Khamira now and let her know that Gharesh-ri, Zamarak, and Prefect Calo have returned and are mostly unscathed."
"103224356-0-49844";"Khamira seems ready to attend the coronation ceremony. She asked me to go to the throne room and wait for her to arrive."
"103224356-0-49845";"The coronation of Khamira has begun. I should observe what happens."
"103224356-0-49846";"Queen Khamira wants to speak to me. I should approach the throne and talk to her."
"103224356-0-49847";"I placed the stone. Now I should wait to see what happens."
"103224356-0-49851";"I must travel to Kulati Mines in Alik'r in order to help train Northern Elsweyr Defense Force recruits to defeat spiders."
"103224356-0-49862";"I showed a Northern Elsweyr Defense Force recruit how to defeat spiders. I should return to Zahari and see what else she needs."
"103224356-0-49863";"Khamira asked me to find out what happened to our companions and the soldiers who helped defend the Moon Gate from the Dragons. I should head out of the city and see what I can learn."
"103224356-0-49876";"I need to craft the furnishing specified by my contract.\n\nOnce I've crafted it, I need to deliver it to any writ turn-in site."
"103224356-0-49877";"I've placed the requested furnishings into the crate. All that remains is to sign the manifest."
"103224356-0-49878";"I must talk to Captain Shideya. She will pair me with a fledgling Khajiit warrior who will observe how I deal with powerful monsters."
"103224356-0-49880";"I need to craft the furnishings specified by my contract.\n\nOnce I've crafted them, I need to deliver them to any writ turn-in site."

"103224356-0-49888";"A Khajiiti loremaster can direct us to the moon-singer storytellers who can recite the secret tales of Khunzar-ri. To secure his help, however, I need to gather dusk mushrooms from the ruin in Auridon, Bewan, to offer as a gift."
"103224356-0-49889";"Now that I have the dusk mushrooms, I should travel to Dagaril-dro's camp on Auridon's coast and offer them as a gift."
"103224356-0-49890";"A Khajiiti loremaster can direct us to the moon-singer storytellers who can recite the secret tales of Khunzar-ri. To secure his help, however, I need to gather dusk mushrooms from the Ayleid ruin in Glenumbra, Enduum, to offer as a gift."
"103224356-0-49891";"A Khajiiti loremaster can direct us to the moon-singer storytellers who can recite the secret tales of Khunzar-ri. To secure his help, however, I need to gather dusk mushrooms from a mine in Stonefalls, Hightide Hollow, to offer as a gift."
"103224356-0-49893";"Now that I have the dusk mushrooms, I should travel to Dagaril-dro's camp on the Glenumbra coast and offer them as a gift."
"103224356-0-49894";"Now that I have the dusk mushrooms, I should travel to Dagaril-dro's camp on the coast of Stonefalls and offer them as a gift."
"103224356-0-49899";"Dagaril-dro accepted the gift of the dusk mushrooms and told me where to find the moon-singer storytellers. I can find them at the Redfur Trading Post, the Baandari Trading Post, and in Rawl'kha. I should let Abnur Tharn know what I learned."
"103224356-0-49900";"I agreed to play the Skooma Cat's games if he'd release the priests from his madness and he's transported me to a warped reflection of the Two Moons Temple. This may be where the Skooma Cat took Sizenza when she vanished. I should search for her."
"103224356-0-49901";"I successfully drew the Skooma Cat's attention away from Sizenza. I need to snap her out of her delusion before he loses interest."
"103224356-0-49903";"Vastarie suggested that we travel to the temple summit and seek out a helpful spirit who can tell us more about Arum-Khal."
"103224356-0-49904";"A talking cat appeared before me. I should try to speak to it."
"103224356-0-49905";"Mazza-Mirri wants me to learn some of the teachings of the Order of the Hidden Moon before she'll help us. I need to read the Teaching Stones scattered around the temple summit."
"103224356-0-49908";"I almost got through to Sizenza, but the Skooma Cat took notice and whisked her away again. I'll have to find her again if I hope to get through to her."
"103224356-0-49909";"I read the Teaching Stones and learned the Hidden Moon's basic teachings. I should talk to Mazza-Mirri about what this all means."
"103224356-0-49910";"Mazza-Mirri promised to tell me more about Arum-Khal. She may even know how we can stop him. I should follow her instructions and enter the Temple of the Hidden Moon."
"103224356-0-49911";"I should listen to what Mazza-Mirri has to tell me about Arum-Khal. It could be the key to stopping this threat."
"103224356-0-49912";"Mazza-Mirri challenged me to prove my strength of will by fighting summoned dro-m'Athra—evil Khajiiti spirits. If I succeed, she will give me a weapon that can kill Arum-Khal permanently. I should proceed deeper into the temple to face this test."
"103224356-0-49913";"I passed Mazza-Mirri's test and earned the right to wield the weapon that can kill Arum-Khal. I should follow her into the next room."
"103224356-0-49914";"A mummified Khajiit sits in a hidden tomb with a sword across his lap. It seems this Moonlight Blade is the weapon I need to destroy Arum-Khal. I should take it."
"103224356-0-49915";"A spirit appeared when I took the blade. I should see what it has to tell me."
"103224356-0-49928";"I lured the Skooma Cat away from Sizenza again. I should speak to her before he comes back."
"103224356-0-49931";"I should talk to the local wildlife ranch's proprietor, Numaia."
"103224356-0-49937";"I should talk to Mazza-Mirri about her plan to stop Arum-Khal for good."
"103224356-0-49940";"I should return to Sweetwater Farmstead and discuss what we learned at Fragrant Moons Plantation with Razum-dar."
"103224356-0-49942";"Sizenza and I emerged back into the real Two Moons Temple, much to Haduras's surprise. It seems like Sheogorath's hold is broken, but I should check on Sizenza to make certain."
"103224356-0-49944";"Sizena's sanity has returned, along with the rest of the priests, and Sheogorath is nowhere to be seen. I should speak to Sizena about what's next for Two Moons Temple."
"103224356-0-49958";"I should speak to Shando-ri about recharging the Moonlight Blade."
"103224356-0-49959";"Vastarie claims that I can strengthen the blade's enchantment by simply wielding it in combat. I need to kill undead in the Ashen Scar and allow the blade to absorb the soul fragments that reanimate them."
"103224356-0-49960";"Now that the Moonlight Blade shimmers and hums with the power of Azurah, I must meet Shando-ri at the temple's entrance: Azurah's Gate."
"103224356-0-49961";"Shando-ri stands ready to enact our plan to destroy Arum-Khal. I must use the Moonlight Blade to open Azurah's Gate."
"103224356-0-49962";"Shando-ri explained that we must destroy the Shades of Arum-Khal that defend his phylacteries. This should permanently sever their ties to this world, and weaken the dark lich."
"103224356-0-49965";"I defeated Arum-Khal's physical form, but his soul proved too powerful for Shando-ri to defeat alone. Vastarie appeared and told me I still have a chance to defeat Arum-Khal if I use the Moonlight Blade to follow him into his shadowy realm."
"103224356-0-49966";"Shando-ri assured me we can still win the fight against the Dark Adept. I need to find the Dark Spirit of Arum-Khal in this strange realm and destroy him before he has a chance to fully reconstitute himself."
"103224356-0-49967";"Vastarie was able to pull me out of the Arum-Khal's realm of darkness, but Shando-ri remained behind. I should talk to Vastarie about what happens next."
"103224356-0-49968";"I used the Moonlight Blade to create a portal to Arum-Khal's shadow realm. I must pass through this breach to pursue him."
"103224356-0-49969";"I arrived in an alien realm of perpetual darkness and found a severely weakened Shando-ri. I should speak with him."
"103224356-0-49970";"Vastarie has an idea that might help us save Shando-ri's soul. I need to raise the Moonlight Blade so she can pull the fragments of Shando-ri's spirit out of Arum-Khal's realm and make them whole again."
"103224356-0-49989";"Now that Shando-ri and I have destroyed two of Arum-Khal's phylacteries, we can mount our final assault on the dark lich in his tomb."
"103224356-0-49994";"Abnur Tharn wants me to go to the Scar and find the hidden Akaviri shrine. He said that he'd send someone to meet me in the Stitches. Meanwhile, he's taking Prefect Calo to Rimmen to discuss the possibility of an alliance."
"103224356-0-49995";"We need to track the assassination squad through the Scar so that we can reach them before they can carry out their order to execute the supposed last surviving member of the Dragonguard."
"103224356-0-50011";"I destroyed the Dark Spirit of Arum-Khal for good. Now, I need to find a way out of this realm."
"103224356-0-50014";"Wait For Vastarie"
"103224356-0-50024";"I defeated Arum-Khal's physical form. Now, Shando-ri must destroy the lich's weakened soul."
"103224356-0-50025";"I entered the tombs. I should search for the magnate."
"103224356-0-50026";"The Akaviri spirit called out to Ashur in recognition, before vanishing once more with the magnate. I should speak to Ashur about what just occurred."
"103224356-0-50027";"I placed the paper lotus in the river. I should speak to Domitia Nasica."
"103224356-0-50032";"Tharn suspected that Cadwell was the source of the surges of power he detected and there he is. I should talk to Cadwell and find out what he's doing here."
"103224356-0-50033";"Lharahad said that he saw a strange, pale-skinned man with a pot on his head wandering around before I arrived. He said the man headed east. I should try to track him down somewhere to the south and east of Riverhold."
"103224356-0-50034";"Cadwell says that he dreamed about this particular gravestone and was somehow drawn to this spot. He asked me to examine it and see what I make of the inscription."
"103224356-0-50035";"I examined the gravestone. It appears to mark the resting place of someone named only as ""The Betrayer."" I should talk to Cadwell and see if that means anything to him."
"103224356-0-50036";"Despite his strange dreams, Cadwell agreed to help us deal with the Dragons. I should head to the outpost of the Northern Elsweyr Defense Force to meet up with Abnur Tharn and Khamira now."
"103224356-0-50037";"Abnur Tharn used his magic to fend off the Dragon attack. I should talk to him and make sure he's all right."
"103224356-0-50038";"The effort Abnur Tharn expended to fend off the Dragon seems to have left him depleted. He asked me to talk to Khamira and see what I can do to help her."
"103224356-0-50039";"Khamira asked me to recover sensitive documents from the ruins of the militia's camp. I should search the tents for mail sacks that contain the important documents."
"103224356-0-50040";"I recovered the documents that Khamira requested. Now I should find Captain Nala-do and deliver the documents to her."
"103224356-0-50041";"I found Captain Nala-do. She defeated a necromancer and his undead. I should deliver the documents I recovered and speak to her."
"103224356-0-50042";"Captain Nala-do headed for Riverhold to consult with Gharesh-ri. I should meet Abnur Tharn and Khamira at the south end of the militia camp and see what we need to do next."
"103224356-0-50043";"Abnur Tharn says that the source of the undead army lies in the mountains to the west. I should go and investigate the area. And if I run into Khamira, I should make sure she's all right."
"103224356-0-50044";"I encountered Khamira and her soldiers on my way to find the source of the undead army. I should talk to her."
"103224356-0-50045";"Khamira and her soldiers tracked the Dragon to the same mountain that houses the source of the undead. We've decided to team up to try to deal with both threats."
"103224356-0-50046";"The source of the undead must be somewhere deep in the mine. I should explore until I find it."
"103224356-0-50047";"I found the lead necromancer who's been raising the undead army here in the western mountains. I need to defeat the necromancer before she replenishes Euraxia's forces."
"103224356-0-50048";"Khamira and her soldiers helped me take down the necromancer. I should wait for her to descend from the cliffside to join me."
"103224356-0-50049";"The Dragon that attacked the Defense Force outpost just incinerated Khamira's soldiers while Khamira herself leaped off the cliff. I need to chase down the Dragon and see if I can deal with it."
"103224356-0-50050";"The Dragon landed before me and requested that we parley. I might as well talk to it and see what it wants."
"103224356-0-50051";"The Dragon Mulaamnir gave me a warning to pass along to Abnur Tharn. It wants us both to leave Elsweyr and stay out of its way. I should wait until it leaves before I determine my next move."
"103224356-0-50052";"Khamira did survive the Dragon attack when she leaped off the cliff. I should talk to her and see what she thinks about my conversation with Mulaamnir."
"103224356-0-50053";"Mulaamnir warned me and Abnur Tharn to leave Elsweyr or suffer the consequences. The Dragon also intimated that it was in control of Rimmen, calling Euraxia its puppet. I need to return to Riverhold and consult with Abnur Tharn and Gharesh-ri."
"103224356-0-50055";"Upon arriving in Riverhold, Cadwell called out to me. I should talk to him and see what he has to say."
"103224356-0-50056";"Cadwell seems to think that the missing head from the grave he saw in his vision might be significant, but that's a problem for later. Right now, Abnur Tharn wants to see me in the Riverhold town hall."
"103224356-0-50057";"Abnur Tharn suggested a meeting with Queen Euraxia. I should talk to him and convince him that a parley is a good idea."
"103224356-0-50065";"I couldn't break the Skooma Cat's influence over Sizenza, but I got her to tell me about the anchor she created beneath the Two Moons Temple at his behest. It seems to be the key to all this chaos. I must find it."
"103224356-0-50066";"With the barrier gone, there's nothing stopping me from destroying the anchor. I should get rid of it before Sheogorath changes his mind."
"103224356-0-50067";"A Dragon! It's attacking the outpost! I need to get over there."
"103224356-0-50068";"I found the letter. I should see what it says."
"103224356-0-50069";"The adepts left a key to my room, so I'm free to leave. I should take the key."
"103224356-0-50070";"I should look around and try to get my bearings."
"103224356-0-50071";"A Khajiit outside my door mentioned a letter. I should find it."
"103224356-0-50072";"Sizenza said the anchor would be under the temple. I need to find it if I hope to break the Skooma Cat's influence on Two Moons Temple."
"103224356-0-50073";"Someone used the habit Vazbi and I found to dress a wound. It's unclear how it arrived in the wilderness, but Vazbi wants to find the robe's owner and see if they need help."
"103224356-0-50083";"I arrived at the doors to Rimmen Palace to find Abnur Tharn dealing with Cadwell. It appears Cadwell is having another one of his visions. Tharn asked me to check on him before joining him in the throne room for the war council."
"103224356-0-50084";"I destroyed the anchor and freed Two Moons from Sheogorath's influence. I should follow Sizenza through the tear in the melded planes before it closes."
"103224356-0-50085";"Sizenza has escaped Sheogorath's twisted reflection of the Two Moons at Tenmar temple. Now I should too."
"103224356-0-50086";"We followed a trail of mysterious items to Baan Dar's Litter, a dangerous and thoroughly forbidden canyon. Vazbi wants to talk before proceeding."
"103224356-0-50090";"The war council is reconvening in the Riverhold town hall. I should go there and join them."
"103224356-0-50091";"I should head to Riverhold in Northern Elsweyr and see what Abnur Tharn has to say."
"103224356-0-50092";"I should speak with Khud af-Hadajja and let him know what happened in the doomvault."
"103224356-0-50093";"I should search the doomvault for any sign of the Daedric device. When I find anything of interest, I should contact Khud with the sending stone."
"103224356-0-50100";"Now that I picked up the key, I can unlock the door and leave my room. I should open the door."
"103224356-0-50101";"Grand Adept Ma'jha-dro has come to check on me. I should speak to him."
"103224356-0-50102";"I should meet Ma'jha-dro in the gardens so that we can start sparring."
"103224356-0-50103";"I found Ma'jha-dro in the gardens. I should let him know I'm ready to spar."
"103224356-0-50104";"I need to spar with Ma'jha-dro to determine if I'm fully healed."
"103224356-0-50105";"We finished sparring and Ma'jha-dro promised to lead me out of Star Haven. I should follow him."
"103224356-0-50106";"A Dragon is attacking Star Haven. Ma'jha-dro told me there's another path through the catacombs that I can use to escape. I should make my way there."
"103224356-0-50107";"I need to get through the catacombs and keep an eye out for any adepts I might be able to help."
"103224356-0-50108";"The Dragon isn't alone. Soldiers and necromancers are also attacking Star Haven, and I found some adepts that are in need of my help. I should save them."
"103224356-0-50109";"The adepts I rescued might be able to tell me more about what's going on. One seems less shaken by the attack than the others. I should find out what she knows."
"103224356-0-50110";"Izjadi told me of an old Akaviri Dragonhorn that was once used to combat Dragons. If I can find it, I might be able to ground the Dragon."
"103224356-0-50111";"I should sound the Dragonhorn and hope it can ground the Dragon so that the adepts can escape."
"103224356-0-50112";"The horn worked, but the Dragon fell from the sky and crashed into the adeptorium. Ma'jha-dro wishes to check if there's any adepts still trapped inside. I should follow him into the adeptorium."
"103224356-0-50113";"The Dragon now blocks our path forward. I'll need to battle him if my companions and I are to escape Star Haven Adeptorium."
"103224356-0-50114";"The Dragon flew off suddenly. I should get out of the adeptorium and escape Star Haven."
"103224356-0-50115";"I should take Morgane's sending stone. It might allow me to make contact with her partner, Khud af-Hadajja."
"103224356-0-50126";"I determined what Euraxia's forces were after in the Desert Wind Adeptorium and got the adepts to commit to aid in defense of the town. Now I should find out what I can do to help."
"103224356-0-50127";"Sizenza, the Moon-Bishop, is trying to reach Khenarthi in the heavens by walking a path into the sky, but this is a delusion put into her head by the Skooma Cat. She'll plummet to her death if I don't try to stop her. I need to reach the balcony."
"103224356-0-50128";"I reached Sizenza, who is standing on the edge of a temple balcony. I should try to reason with her, so she doesn't fall to her death."
"103224356-0-50129";"Something is happening to Sizenza. I should observe her carefully."
"103224356-0-50130";"Abnur Tharn wants me to meet him in Rimmen before we head to the palace to parley with his half-sister, Euraxia."
"103224356-0-50131";"Abnur Tharn offered to give me a tour of Rimmen so I could understand how Euraxia keeps the Khajiiti in line. I can accompany him or refuse and make my own way to the palace."
"103224356-0-50132";"I need to accompany Abnur Tharn to Euraxia's throne room inside the palace."
"103224356-0-50138";"On the way to Euraxia's throne room, the necromancer Zumog Phoom intercepted me. I should see what he has to say."
"103224356-0-50139";"After a conversation with Queen Euraxia's chief necromancer, Zumog Phoom, I learned that he reanimated Cadwell's original head through necromantic means. Now I need to meet Abnur Tharn in the throne room."
"103224356-0-50140";"I entered the throne room. Now I need to step forward and wait to be introduced to Euraxia Tharn."
"103224356-0-50141";"Euraxia dismissed her half-brother Abnur and instead asked to talk to me. I guess it's up to me to present our case and convince Euraxia that the Dragons plan to betray her."
"103224356-0-50142";"Euraxia never meant to honor the terms of the parley. I need to defend myself and Abnur Tharn before Euraxia's guards overwhelm us."
"103224356-0-50143";"Abnur Tharn used his magic to teleport us out of the throne room. I should talk to him."
"103224356-0-50144";"Euraxia's wards stopped Abnur Tharn from teleporting us out of the palace. Instead, we wound up in the sewers beneath it. The effort weakened Tharn. I need to protect him as we make our escape."
"103224356-0-50145";"I helped Abnur Tharn get out of the sewers beneath Rimmen Palace. I should talk to him about what we learned."
"103224356-0-50146";"We learned that Euraxia has multiple plans in motion. While Abnur Tharn returns to Riverhold to warn Gharesh-ri of an upcoming attack, I need to go to the Desert Wind Adeptorium and find out what her forces are doing there."
"103224356-0-50147";"It appears that the main gates to the adeptorium have been sealed. I need to find another way to get inside."
"103224356-0-50148";"A Khajiiti adept defends the entrance to the adeptorium. I should let him know I'm here to help against Euraxia's forces."
"103224356-0-50149";"Zamarak held the closing door long enough for me to get into the grand hall, but he's trapped on the other side. It's up to me to rescue the Grand Adept."
"103224356-0-50150";"A Euraxian battlemage! I need to deal with her before she gets away."
"103224356-0-50151";"The battlemage's shade was pulled from her dead body and drawn through a nearby door. I should follow her and see what happens."
"103224356-0-50152";"Zamarak arrived, but we were too late to save the Grand Adept or to keep Zumog Phoom from learning the secret he sent the Euraxians to uncover. Now he knows where to find the rest of the Betrayer's body. I should talk to Zamarak."
"103224356-0-50153";"The necromancer Zumog Phoom has trapped the shade of the battlemage. I need to watch and see what's happening here."

"103224356-0-50907";"The portal that Abnur Tharn opened deposited us in an ancient structure of some sort. I should speak to Tharn and see how he wants us to proceed."
"103224356-0-50908";"We need to explore these ancient ruins and find a way to lower the aegis, the magical defenses that protect the island of Dragonhold."
"103224356-0-50909";"We found a tapestry within the ancient ruins and Tharn wants to examine it. I should ask him if his examination yielded any important information."
"103224356-0-50910";"The Dragon Joorahmaar ordered the cultists to keep feeding the ritual sites. Finding the source of the magic protecting the island needs to wait. The ritual sites must be destroyed."
"103224356-0-50919";"We need to continue to explore these ancient ruins and find the aegis, the source of the magic that's protecting this island."
"103224356-0-50920";"I destroyed the ritual sites. Now I need to continue my search for the aegis, the source of the magic that protects Dragonhold."
"103224356-0-50921";"Abnur Tharn and I attracted the attention of one of Kaalgrontiid's Dragons. I should protect Tharn while he deals with the Dragon Joorahmaar."
"103224356-0-50922";"Tharn thinks the wounded Dragon will lead us to the aegis, the source of Dragonhold's defenses. We should follow it and see where it leads."
"103224356-0-50926";"We discovered another tapestry. I should talk to Abnur Tharn and see what he makes of the images it depicts."
"103224356-0-50927";"Something is happening to Dragonhold. The tremors strike with more regularity and intensity. We need to find the aegis, the source of the island's defenses, and destroy it while we still can."
"103224356-0-50928";"The wounded Dragon Joorahmaar guards the aegis. I need to deal with the Dragon while Tharn attempts to destroy the aegis and lower the island's defenses. Then we can worry about Kaalgrontiid."
"103224356-0-50929";"I killed the wounded Dragon while Tharn destroyed the aegis and removed the magic that protected the island. Kaalgrontiid, meanwhile, caused the island to start to rise into the sky. We need to find a way off Dragonhold before it shakes itself apart."
"103224356-0-50933";"Abnur Tharn created a portal to get me off the island, but he remained behind. Dragonhold has risen into the sky. I need to find Khamira and Sai Sahan and let them know what happened."
"103224356-0-50934";"Sai Sahan and Khamira seem at a loss for how to get the Dragonguard to the island. I should talk to Sai and see if I can help."
"103224356-0-50936";"I returned to the Dragonguard Sanctum. I should let Sai Sahan know what happened."
"103224356-0-50938";"Za'ji showed up after I spoke with Nahfahlaar, curious about our next mission. I should let him know about our task."
"103224356-0-50939";"Za'ji believes a temple in the village of Black Heights can help us find Yahgrondu. I should meet him there."
"103224356-0-50940";"Kasura requested that I meet her in one of the nearby cities. I should head there now."
"103224356-0-50941";"Kasura says I must first activate three glyphs to determine which glyphs in a series will reveal the entrance to the tomb. I should head to the spots she marked on my map and activate these glyphs. I can consult her notes for more information."
"103224356-0-50942";"Kasura asked me to search a Dragonguard tomb, but the entrance is currently hidden. I should read her notes for more information."
"103224356-0-50943";"I know which three glyphs will reveal the entrance to the tomb, but I need to determine the proper order to activate them in."
"103224356-0-50944";"I activated the proper glyphs and revealed the tomb's door. I should enter and search for anything that appears useful."
"103224356-0-50945";"I found a map to a Dragonguard sanctuary. I should exit the tomb, find Kasura, and let her know what I discovered."
"103224356-0-50946";"Kasura wants me to accompany her to the Abbey of Blades, located in the Valley of Blades, to present the maps we found to her former student."
"103224356-0-50947";"I arrived at the Abbey of Blades in the Dragontail Mountains. Kasura wants me to present the maps we found to her former student."
"103224356-0-50949";"Sai Sahan finished studying one of the maps and now knows the location of the Wind Scour Temple. Its entrance lies within HoonDing's Watch in Alik'r. I can ride the horse Sai provided or make my own way there."
"103224356-0-50950";"Sai believes the Horn of Ja'darri would help us fight back against the Dragon invasion. The journal states the Dragonhorn may be in Storm Talon Temple. We'll find its entrance within Aphren's Hold in Stormhaven. I should head there next."
"103224356-0-50952";"Once I lit the braziers in the proper order, a grappling point lifted out of the floor. I can use it to reach the Dragonguard archives."
"103224356-0-50953";"I made my way to the Dragonguard archives. Now, I must search the tomes to see if there's anything that can help us fight against Dragons."
"103224356-0-50954";"I need to use my grappling bow to reach the Dragonguard archives. I  should be careful where I grapple to, as there may be only one path forward."
"103224356-0-50955";"I used the grappling bow to reach the Dragonguard archives. I don't see any relics nearby, but I should try to find more clues about the Horn of Ja'darri."
"103224356-0-50957";"The journal we found indicates the Dark Water Temple is located south of Windhelm, in Eastmarch. I should travel there and try to find the entrance."
"103224356-0-50958";"I found the entrance to Dark Water Temple. I should head inside."
"103224356-0-50959";"Like the other two sanctuaries, there doesn't seem to be an obvious way forward. I should search the bookshelves near the entrance for clues."
"103224356-0-50960";"I found a letter with a riddle describing a path over the chasm. Meanwhile, Sai Sahan has discovered a grappling point leading to an urn. I should use my grappling bow to reach the urn and search it."
"103224356-0-50961";"The letter said I should take the dust of ""our fallen foe"" and ""offer it to the altar."" I should try using the Dragonbone powder on the altar and see if a pathway is revealed."
"103224356-0-50962";"The Dragonbone powder revealed an invisible path over the water. If I follow the trail revealed by the powder, I should be able to travel deeper into the sanctuary."
"103224356-0-50963";"I found the Dark Water Temple's archives, but there's no sign of the Horn of Ja'darri. I should see if I can find any information about the Dragonhorn."
"103224356-0-50964";"I found another journal written by the Dragonguard commander who long ago sought the Horn of Ja'darri. It says that the horn was stolen by a Dragon, whose lair is in Southern Elsweyr. I should let Sai know this new information."
"103224356-0-50965";"Sai Sahan wants to return to the Abbey of Blades to plan and check in with Kasura. I should meet him there."
"103224356-0-50966";"I should let Kasura know what we discovered in the Dragonguard sanctuaries."
"103224356-0-50967";"Sai Sahan has returned to the Abbey of Blades. I should speak to him about our next step in finding the Horn of Ja'darri."
"103224356-0-50975";"Clan Mother Tadali is furous with Za'ji and has refused to hear his request. I should speak to her and see if I can convince her to help us find Yahgrondu."
"103224356-0-50976";"Clan Mother Tadali said she would help if we returned a temple bell that Za'ji stole. I should ask Za'ji what happened to it."
"103224356-0-50977";"We entered Wind Scour Temple, but its archives appear to be unreachable. I should see what Sai thinks about the situation."
"103224356-0-50978";"Sai Sahan believes that we must light the braziers in a specific order to reach the archives. I should read the plaques in front of the statues to see if they offer any clues."
"103224356-0-50980";"The infamous skooma lord, Bahzahar the Bull, has the temple bell. I should locate his hideout in Moonlit Cove and retrieve it."
"103224356-0-50981";"Bahzahar's hideout is located somewhere in Moonlit Cove. I should search for the hideout's entrance."
"103224356-0-50986";"The hideout's entrance is locked tight. I should speak to Za'ji about this."
"103224356-0-50997";"I acquired the key to Bahzahar's hideout. I should head inside and see if I can find the temple bell."
"103224356-0-51000";"I made my way into Bahzahar's hideout. I should search for the temple bell."
"103224356-0-51003";"Clan Mother Tadali asked me to return the temple bell to its hook so that it may ring with its counterparts. I should do so."
"103224356-0-51004";"Something seems to be wrong with the temple bell. I should ask Clan Mother Tadali what the problem is."
"103224356-0-51005";"The temple bell must be magically cleansed to return it to its proper tune. I should listen to Clan Mother Tadali in order to learn how to cleanse it."
"103224356-0-51006";"Za'ji interrupted Clan Mother Tadali's explanation, causing her to storm off in a huff. I should talk to Za'ji to see if he knows how to cleanse the temple bell."
"103224356-0-51008";"Za'ji admits he isn't sure how to cleanse the temple bell, but he's going to improvise. I should see what he does."
"103224356-0-51009";"Za'ji pressed a pedestal and the small temple bells began to ring in a certain order, causing colorful symbols to light. Perhaps there's something nearby that can help cleanse the tarnished bell."
"103224356-0-51017";"By hitting the larger bells in the courtyard to match the smaller bells' song, I cleansed the tarnished bell. Clan Mother Tadali has returned. I should speak to her."
"103224356-0-51018";"Clan Mother Tadali agreed to use the power of the temple bells to find the Dragon Yahgrondu. I should listen to what she says."
"103224356-0-51019";"Clan Mother Tadali said that Yahgrondu is in a mine. I should search for it."
"103224356-0-51020";"The quarry is overrun by Dragon cultists. I should enter the mine beneath the cliffs and see if I can find Yahgrondu."
"103224356-0-51021";"Laatvulon is in the mine, and he's arguing with another Dragon. Is that Yahgrondu? I should head deeper into the mine and see what's happening."
"103224356-0-51022";"Laatvulon killed Yahgrondu and a mysterious Khajiiti necromancer raised him as an undead Dragon. I must defend myself and defeat the now undead Yahgrondu."
"103224356-0-51023";"Nahfahlaar can't think of any other Dragons that might be willing to ally with us, so we must fight Laatvulon with the forces we have. I should return to the Dragonguard Sanctum and let Sai Sahan know where we stand."
"103224356-0-51024";"I know which three glyphs will reveal the entrance to the Dragonguard tomb. I should head to the spot marked on my map now."
"103224356-0-51033";"I returned to the Dragonguard Sanctum. I should let Sai Sahan know what happened."
"103224356-0-51034";"The Wall of Life is restored and Vijari has passed on. I should speak to Adara'hai if our exorcism was successful."
"103224356-0-51037";"Vijari has gone to the Wall of Life, located in a cave beyond the rear of town. Adara'hai asked me to help her find him and assist in any exorcism she needs to perform."
"103224356-0-51038";"We found Vijari at the Wall of Life, but he is enthralled by some grotesque mural flowing with shadowy energies. Adara'hai told me to try snapping him out of his trance."
"103224356-0-51041";"Khamira believes that her ancestor, Anequina Sharp-Tongue, wants me to go to Moonlit Cove. Apparently, the answer to our dilemma can be found there."
"103224356-0-51042";"Sai Sahan asked me to talk to Khamira. He thinks her portal magic may be our only option for reaching Dragonhold, but she's reluctant to try without Abnur Tharn's guidance."
"103224356-0-51045";"The restored tablet provided a riddle. Apparently the Khajiiti hero Khunzar-ri rests beyond the door. I should open the door and see what awaits us on the other side."
"103224356-0-51046";"The door opened upon a large, hidden chamber. Could this be the final resting place of the hero Khunzar-ri? I should approach the sarcophagus at the far end of the chamber."
"103224356-0-51047";"The ghost cat disappeared as I approached the sarcophagus. I should open it and see if what Khamira sent us to find is waiting inside."
"103224356-0-51048";"The spirit that claims to be the legendary hero Khunzar-ri told me to take one of his claws from his sarcophagus and present it to Khamira."
"103224356-0-51049";"Khamira opened a portal that she thinks will take us to the Jonelight Path. If she's right, we can reach Dragonhold from there. In case she's wrong, we're leaving the rest of the Dragonguard behind. Just in case."
"103224356-0-51050";"Khamira's portal took us to the Jonelight Path. We need to walk the path to find where it connects to the floating island of Dragonhold."
"103224356-0-51051";"We reached Dragonhold. Now to talk to Khamira and determine how we're going to stop Kaalgrontiid from becoming the Dark Aeon."
"103224356-0-51052";"Nahfahlaar spotted a number of focal points around the island, aeonstones set up specifically to reflect and enhance Kaalgrontiid's power until it builds to a level to ignite his ascension. I need to destroy these focal points."
"103224356-0-51053";"I destroyed one of Kaalgrontiid's focal points on Dragonhold. I should find and destroy any that still remain."
"103224356-0-51054";"I destroyed another of Kaalgrontiid's focal points. I should find and destroy any that still remain."
"103224356-0-51055";"We destroyed the Dark Aeon focal points and stopped the flow of energy to Kaalgrontiid. Now we need to reach the Dragon and make sure he can't complete his ascension."
"103224356-0-51056";"We found Abnur Tharn. It appears he survived his time alone on the floating island. I should talk to him."
"103224356-0-51057";"Although we destroyed the focal points, Tharn believes Kaalgrontiid will try to go ahead with his ascension anyway. But if he makes the slightest mistake, he could unleash enough energy to destroy Elsweyr and maybe all of Tamriel. We need to stop him"
"103224356-0-51058";"We reached the center of Dragonhold. Now I have to stop Kaalgrontiid once and for all."
"103224356-0-51059";"We defeated Kaalgrontiid, but now the island is shaking apart and the aeonstone containing all of the Dark Aeon energy is about to explode. I need to talk to Abnur Tharn about how we stop this."
"103224356-0-51060";"Khamira opened a portal. We should use it to escape Dragonhold."
"103224356-0-51061";"I returned to the Dragonguard Sanctum and Sai Sahan wants to talk to me. I should see what he has to say."
"103224356-0-51062";"When I opened the sarcophagus, a spectral Pahmar appeared. Could that be the spirit of Khunzar-ri? I should talk to him."
"103224356-0-51063";"Vijari still seems to be in the grip of some dark power. I should ask Adara'hai about what's happening to him."
"103224356-0-51074";"Sai Sahan and I found the ancient, hidden door in Moonlit Cove. I should speak to him before we open it and see what waits inside."
"103224356-0-51076";"The door refuses to budge. Sai Sahan thinks the missing tablet pieces might be some sort of key. I should try to find them."
"103224356-0-51077";"I recovered the tablet fragments. I should return to the hidden door and see if I can repair the broken tablet."
"103224356-0-51078";"I have all the ingredients Dak'radhi used for his cursed paint. I should ask Adara'hai what she's planning to use them for."
"103224356-0-51079";"Dak'radhi's memories showed me the ingredients he used to make his cursed paint. Adara'hai asked me to retrieve them and meet her at the Colorworks in Black Heights."
"103224356-0-51085";"Sai Sahan has prepared horses to take us to the nearest port. From there, a chartered ship will take us to Southern Elsweyr. I should let Sai know when I'm ready to depart or simply use the horse he provided."
"103224356-0-51086";"We arrived at the dormant volcano that serves as the lair of the Dragon Vahlokzin. We should tread carefully as we search for the Horn of Ja'darri."
"103224356-0-51087";"The inside of the dormant volcano appears to be an abandoned kwama mine. Whoever formed this mine and imported the kwama is long gone, but a flourishing kwama colony remains. We should continue to search for the Dragonhorn."
"103224356-0-51088";"Vahlokzin's powerful roars have stirred the kwama into a violent frenzy. I must defeat the kwama swarm to survive."
"103224356-0-51089";"We need to press on and find the Horn of Ja'darri. Since Vahlokzin uses kwama as a form of defense, we need to keep an eye out for more of the creatures as we make our way toward the summit."
"103224356-0-51090";"A raised drawbridge blocks our path. I should figure out how to use the nearby pulleys to lower the drawbridge."
"103224356-0-51091";"A path to the summit stretches ahead, where the Horn of Ja'darri awaits us. We should keep going forward."
"103224356-0-51092";"Sai Sahan and I must work together in order to defeat the Dragon Vahlokzin."
"103224356-0-51093";"The Dragon Vahlokzin is dead and we have the Horn of Ja'darri. I should return to the Abbey of Blades, located in the Valley of Blades, and inform Kasura of our success."
"103224356-0-51094";"I returned to the Abbey of Blades. I should inform Kasura about what we accomplished."
"103224356-0-51095";"With the Horn of Ja'darri in his possession, Sai Sahan plans to fight back against the Dragons invading Elsweyr. But first, he must plan for what comes next. I should speak to him about that."
"103224356-0-51099";"I drank the cantor's tonic and can now see a dark energy clinging to Vijari and other things connected to the source of this corruption. I should learn all I can from these residual memories."
"103224356-0-51101";"The darkness clinging to Vijari comes from his departed father, Dak'radhi, who became a dro-m'Athra in a misguided attempt to save his son from a premature death. I need to get back to Vijari's house and inform Adara'hai."
"103224356-0-51102";"The darkness clinging to Vijari is coming from his departed father, Dak'radhi, who became dro-m'Athra in a misguided attempt to save his son from a premature death. I should tell Adara'hai what I learned."
"103224356-0-51108";"Adara'hai plans to have Vijari make his own paint, which she will consecrate, and use it to cleanse the mural at the Wall of Life. She asked me to clear a path for them, and ring the Khenarthic bells to signal it's safe."
"103224356-0-51110";"I arrived at the Wall of Life and the darkness that permeated the cave has returned. I need to strike a Khenarthic bell to drive it out and signal that it's safe for the others to join me."
"103224356-0-51112";"Adara'hai's plan is for us to enter the Passage of Dad'na Ghaten to hunt for Dak'radhi while Vijari works to cleanse the Wall of Life. The entrance is to the right of the Wall, obscured by overgrowth."
"103224356-0-51113";"We found Dak'radhi at the end of the Passage of Dad'na Ghaten. We need to banish him back to the Dark Behind the World."
"103224356-0-51114";"I destroyed Dak'radhi's body, but it's not enough to banish him from our world. Adara'hai told me to strike the Advent Bell to finish the exorcism."
"103224356-0-51116";"The grotesque mural is gone and the Wall of Life is restored, but Vijari seems to be nearing the end of his life. He's asked to speak to me."
"103224356-0-51118";"Sai Sahan has returned to the Abbey of Blades. I should speak to him."
"103224356-0-51119";"Khamira waits for me on the coast of Southern Elsweyr. I should speak to her."
"103224356-0-51120";"I told Sai Sahan what I learned about the Order of the New Moon. I should speak to him about my reward."
"103224356-0-51121";"If the Dragon cult is recruiting in the city, General Renmus should know something about it. I should speak to him."
"103224356-0-51122";"The Advent Bell banished the Great Darkness from our world and Dak'radhi along with it. We should return to the Wall of Life and see if Vijari was able to cleanse it as well."
"103224356-0-51123";"Sai Sahan awaits me in front of the Senchal Palace. I should speak to him."
"103224356-0-51124";"General Renmus, leader of Senchal's military forces, could get us the boat we need. I should hear how Sai plans to get us a meeting with the general."
"103224356-0-51125";"We need to meet with General Renmus as soon as possible. To do this, I must bribe his clerk, obtain forged credentials, and delay the merchant who is currently scheduled to meet with him."
"103224356-0-51126";"I now have the means to meet with General Renmus. I should let Sai know."
"103224356-0-51127";"General Renmus dismissed Sai Sahan's request. I should speak to the general and see if I can convince him to arrange our passage to the Dragon's island."
"103224356-0-51128";"General Renmus refused our request, citing his lack of resources during these troubled times. We must find another way to reach the island. I should speak to Sai outside and see if he has any ideas."
"103224356-0-51129";"Aeliah Renmus, the general's daughter, approached us. I should see what she wants."
"103224356-0-51130";"Aeliah believes the smuggler Za'ji can help us reach the Dragon's island lair. I can find him and his crew in the outskirts of Senchal."
"103224356-0-51131";"I found Za'ji and his first mate Caska. I should see if he will agree to sail us to the Dragon's island lair."
"103224356-0-51132";"Za'ji will sail us to the Dragon's lair if we help him recover his beloved ship, the Perfect Pounce. He believes we'll find the mer who stole it in South Guard Ruins. I should head there now."
"103224356-0-51133";"Za'ji and Caska can't agree on a course of action for capturing Nartise Merys, the mer who Za'ji believes stole his ship. I should speak to Sai Sahan about our next move."
"103224356-0-51134";"While Caska and Za'ji sneak around South Guard Ruins and enter from the back, Sai and I will start our search for Nartise at the front. This should allow us to capture Nartise and interrogate him about the Pounce."
"103224356-0-51135";"Sai smashed the trap door open. Now we can follow Nartise into the tunnel below. I should continue my pursuit."
"103224356-0-51136";"Za'ji has suspended Nartise with magic. I should see if Nartise knows where we can find the Perfect Pounce."
"103224356-0-51137";"Nartise revealed that he sold the boat to the slaver Admiral Irathi. Now that the Dark Elf has revealed his betrayal, Za'ji seems to have plans for his former crew member."
"103224356-0-51138";"Za'ji catapulted Nartise deep into the sea. I should speak to him about what just occurred."
"103224356-0-51139";"Nartise claimed that the Perfect Pounce is docked nearby. I should speak to Sai Sahan about our next step."
"103224356-0-51140";"Sai and Za'ji will draw away as many slavers as they can. Meanwhile, Caska and I will secure the Perfect Pounce. I should head to the docks and look for the ship."
"103224356-0-51141";"Admiral Irathi has locked the ship's wheel with thick chains. I should get rid of the chains and secure the ship until Za'ji and Sai return."
"103224356-0-51146";"Before we depart for the Dragon's island lair, we need to pick up Za'ji's crew. I should sail the ship to Senchal."
"103224356-0-51147";"Aeliah has boarded the Perfect Pounce. I should speak to her."
"103224356-0-51148";"Za'ji's crew is on board and ready to set sail. I should speak to Sai about our departure."

"103224356-0-51150";"We arrived on the back side of the island, on a small beach. There's another ship docked nearby, which means we're likely not the only ones on this island. I should speak to Sai about our next move."
"103224356-0-51151";"While Sai, Caska, and Aeliah enter the ruins directly, I need to see where a nearby cavern leads. I should head to the cavern now and begin my search for the Dragon."

"103224356-0-51160";"Sai believes the ruins are actually a Dragonguard sanctuary. With that revelation in mind, he's more determined than ever to slay this Dragon. I should follow him to the chamber ahead and search for the Dragon."

"103224356-0-51178";"According to Daini, Turo places his personal goods in marked crates. We should search the crates and try to find something valuable."
"103224356-0-51179";"Antonia sold out Daini and her friends to Turo, just as she said she would. The crime boss clearly means to do them harm. I should return to Daini's shelter to warn Safik and the others."

"103224356-0-51182";"While Daini turns herself in to Turo, I must search a nearby safe house for any sign of her compatriots: Galeneth, Malahbu, and Sormund. Once I rescue them all, I can assist Daini in Turo's fortress."

"103224356-0-51238";"I must complete the Path of the New Moon to prove myself to the cult. The trial master explained that I need to light braziers to open pathways and push the large sliding stones to unlock the door and move forward."

"103224356-0-51254";"With a few cryptic words and a hasty exit, Nahfahlaar wasn't able to reveal much about the cult's motivation. I should head to Pridehome and meet up with the rest of the Dragonguard."

"103224356-0-51265";"The statue depicts a warrior named Ja'darri. Its inscription speaks of a Red Beast and Mask Divine. Could this warrior be connected to Nahfahlaar? I should speak to Sai Sahan about what I discovered."
"103224356-0-51266";"Sai Sahan suspects that Nahfahlaar is somehow connected to the warrior Ja'darri and the divine mask the cult seeks. I should search for the Dragon so I can question him about the mask."
"103224356-0-51271";"Nahfahlaar remains cryptic about his connection to Ja'darri and the mask, but he did reveal that Ja'darri's remains were taken to Khenarthi's Breath Temple when she died. I should head there and see what I can learn about the mask."

"103224356-0-51275";"Clan Mother Tadali told me to go to a nearby statue of a Forgotten Mane surrounded by bells. I should check in with Aeliah first."

"103224356-0-51279";"Aeliah is determined to help find the divine mask. I should meet her by the Forgotten Mane statue, southeast of Black Heights."
"103224356-0-51280";"I found another bell stand, but every bell hanging on it is tarnished. I should press the pedal and see what happens."
"103224356-0-51281";"The bell stand played a short song and its brightly colored lanterns glowed. I'll need to hit the larger bells in a specific order to cleanse the smaller bells."
"103224356-0-51282";"The divine mask is in the Halls of the Highmane, but I have to prove myself worthy of the relic first. I should head inside."
"103224356-0-51283";"Aeliah gave me a Dragonguard grappling bow to help me cross the chasm. I should be able to open the way for her if I can make it across."
"103224356-0-51284";"The next door is blocked, surrounded by four unlit braziers. It seems this trial is about overcoming darkness. I should search the chamber and see how I can open the door."
"103224356-0-51285";"Our path is blocked by another trial. I need to figure out the solution so we can move forward and continue our search for the mask."
"103224356-0-51286";"Clan Mother Tadali appeared just as the bells were cleansed. I should speak to her about what happens next."
"103224356-0-51287";"The spirit of Ja'darri appeared and warned that only one of us can claim the mask. I should speak to Aeliah about this new development."

"103224356-0-51289";"Ra'khajin seeks the mask for himself. I have to defeat him to keep it out of the cult's hands."
"103224356-0-51290";"I defeated Ra'khajin, Dragon Priest of the Order of the New Moon. Now I should claim the mask."
"103224356-0-51296";"I found an ancient shield at the location of the grave, I should take it to <<1>> to see if it's useful."
"103224356-0-51300";"I need to follow it to the burial site in Windridge Cave and retrieve any relics I find."

"103224356-0-51310";"Bebbia was very thankful for Nishzo's piece of the tapestry. She has hired an artisan to restore the masterpiece once I retrieve the remaining pieces."
"103224356-0-51311";"I should talk to Bebbia now that the first piece of the tapestry has been placed in the frame."
"103224356-0-51316";"We found Nartise, but he fled into a tunnel and locked the door behind him. I should wait for Sai to determine a course of action."
"103224356-0-51322";"A Pahmar guards the entrance to the Black Kiergo. I should speak to him."
"103224356-0-51323";"Do'mazir doesn't find me worthy of the Black Kiergo, but is eager to see Caska rejoin the fight. If I can convince my companion to enter the competition, we can both enter the arena and find the New Moon recruiter."
"103224356-0-51324";"Sai Sahan and Abnur Tharn arrived before me, but Tharn doesn't look well. I should talk to Sai."
"103224356-0-51325";"We think the amphitheater where the cult collects the aeonstone might contain a clue as to how they reach the island, but the entrance we used last time is sealed. We need to find another way inside."
"103224356-0-51326";"Sai Sahan and I discovered a second entrance into the New Moon Fortress. I should see if it leads to the amphitheater."
"103224356-0-51327";"I found Nishzo's journal. It's filled with strange riddles that might be clues to the locations of the tapestry pieces. I should search the cave for his piece."

"103224356-0-51344";"The kidnappers who abducted Skordo and the others clearly fled in a hurry. I should inspect the area. With any luck, I'll find some clues that can lead me to Marekki and Tajahir."
"103224356-0-51347";"Auberic Dufont's house might contain more information about Lady G's mysterious event. Skordo plans to distract Auberic. I should search the residence for clues."
"103224356-0-51348";"I tied up Skordo. Now, I must take him to Selloe and Lady G."
"103224356-0-51350";"I should talk to Selloe. Hopefully she takes the bait and accepts Skordo as we planned."
"103224356-0-51351";"Lady Ghisiliane gave me a token and urged me to travel to the swamps east of Purring Rock to participate in the hunt. I should give the token to a hunt master when I arrive."
"103224356-0-51352";"I officially entered the hunt. Now I should look for Skordo and his two friends, Tajahir and Marekki."
"103224356-0-51353";"Tajahir told me that Marekki plans to kill Lady G. Given her size and inexperience, she'll almost certainly be killed. I should hurry to the ruins and make sure she doesn't go through with her plan."
"103224356-0-51355";"Lady Ghisiliane's despicable games will continue so long as she remains alive. I need to end this before she hurts more innocent people."

"103224356-0-51363";"We interrupted the ritual, but Laatvulon is now aware of our presence. I should meet back up with Caska so we can escape the New Moon Fortress."

"103224356-0-51404";"Kasura challenged me to light a brazier on top of the training hall roof by using the grappling bow. This will test my skill with the Dragonguard device."
"103224356-0-51405";"I lit the brazier on the roof of the training hall. I should return to Sai Sahan and see if he's deciphered the maps."

"103224356-0-51419";"Vijari seemed to be chanting something in response to me, though it was cryptic at best. Adara'hai might have some idea what he was babbling about."

"103224356-0-51466";"Nahfahlaar was felled by Laatvulon as we arrived at the gates of Doomstone Keep. I should speak with Sai Sahan."

"103224356-0-51473";"The tapestries told the story of Ja'darri and the Dragonguard battling Laatvulon. They weren't able to kill him, but sealed him beneath Doomstone Keep instead. Obviously, he eventually found a way out. I should go inside and see what I can find."

"103224356-0-52202";"I found first mate Drigsen taking refuge in a shipwreck. I should talk to her."
"103224356-0-52203";"Drigsen says the beast that took her crew mates and captain is actually a large Khajiit. I should track down this Khajiit to find the captain."
"103224356-0-52204";"The captain doesn't seem to be at the Khajiit's camp. I should search the areas for clues."
"103224356-0-52205";"I found orders from Maxten Favrete. These instructions mention a stronghold and a place beneath called Verglas Hollow. I should see if the ruins up ahead lead to anything."
"103224356-0-52206";"A frozen door blocks our path. I must find a way to destroy the ice that prevents us from passing."
"103224356-0-52207";"Zan'ikh's orders detail the collection of frozen corpses. Maxten may have Captain Mavvok held in a lab somewhere beneath Verglas Hollow."

"103224356-0-52209";"Maxten uses a strange Frost Focus to harness her magic. I need to destroy it in order to stop her."
"103224356-0-52212";"I need to gather samples of skin from cursed people and blood from undead wolves. Old Mjolen says she can learn about the curse from these specimens."
"103224356-0-52213";"I gathered the ingredients. I should deliver them to Old Mjolen."
"103224356-0-52218";"I should investigate the western farm for details about recent wolf attacks. The survivors reported seeing undead and ghosts."
"103224356-0-52219";"Freiwen stopped me at the Kjenstag ruins and revealed she is still alive. I should return to Morthal and deliver the news to Lady Ninetha."
"103224356-0-52220";"Freiwen told me she believes that only her death can end the curse. I should bring the locket she gave me to Lady Ninetha at the Whispering Axe Tavern."
"103224356-0-52221";"Old Mjolen told me to fill Freiwen's locket with life energy to break the curse. I need to use the locket to capture memories around Morthal."

"103224356-0-52223";"A strange woman emerged from a sudden ice storm and accused me of following her. I should speak to her and find out who she is."
"103224356-0-52224";"Lady Ninetha left to find Freiwen at the tree overlooking Morthal. I need to find the tree before the curse kills her."
"103224356-0-52230";"The ritual broke Freiwen's curse and saved her life. I should talk to Lady Ninetha."
"103224356-0-52231";"The ritual freed Freiwen and revived Lady Ninetha. I should talk to Ninetha."
"103224356-0-52232";"Tranya is searching for the pack's missing alchemist, Rasir, who was close to developing a cure. I should help her determine where he was last seen."

"103224356-0-52251";"Svana asked me to meet her at the Blue Palace so we can once again try to convince High King Svargrim of the threat posed by the Icereach Coven and their allies."
"103224356-0-52252";"The meeting between Svana and High King Svargrim didn't go well. I should speak to her."
"103224356-0-52253";"In light of her father's unwillingness to act, Svana has decided to take matters into her own hands. She asked me to meet her in Morthal where she seeks an audience with Jarl Reddharn."

"103224356-0-52255";"Jarl Reddharn's soldiers destroyed witch pikes they found around Morthal, but they disappeared after reporting Reachmen activity at the barrow. I agreed to investigate the barrow and find out what happened to the soldiers."

"103224356-0-52267";"The coven witch from the barrow appeared. She seems intent on protecting the funeral urn that she calls a gray reliquary. Svana wants me to destroy it."
"103224356-0-52271";"Svana thinks the gray reliquaries are important to the coven. We should find any others still around the town and destroy them."
"103224356-0-52272";"We destroyed all of the gray reliquaries we could find. Now we need to check on Jarl Olfwenn and see if she's all right."
"103224356-0-52273";"Inside the jarl's hall, it appears that a battle took place. Dead villagers and harrowfiends litter the room, but there's one person still alive. I should talk to her."
"103224356-0-52274";"Magister Fridelja sent Jarl Olfwenn to the cellar when the harrowstorm began. She asked me to go down there and make sure the jarl is all right."
"103224356-0-52275";"Jarl Olfwenn is dead. Svana requested that I recover the Karthald Crown before returning to the hall above."
"103224356-0-52278";"While Svana leads Magister Fridelja and the Karthwatch survivors to Solitude, she wants me to return to Solitude and find Lyris before meeting her in the Blue Palace."
"103224356-0-52279";"Now that I'm back in Solitude, I need to find Lyris and let her know the princess wants to meet with us in the Blue Palace."
"103224356-0-52280";"Now that Lyris and I are back together, it's time to go to the Blue Palace and meet up with Princess Svana."
"103224356-0-52281";"I found evidence that suggests there is some truth to the Cormorant's crew claims about a beast roaming this frozen tundra. Perhaps the captain and first mate are close by."

"103224356-0-52284";"We arrived in Eastmarch. Lyris says we need to head into the mountains and look for the Grinning Horker inn."
"103224356-0-52285";"Lyris and I entered the Grinning Horker in Eastmarch. Everything appears quiet. I should talk to Lyris so we can discuss our next move."
"103224356-0-52286";"Lyris and I need to search the desolate inn and see if we can find anything that points to what the Icereach Coven is planning."
"103224356-0-52288";"The inn appears to have been abandoned in a hurry, but we found a trail of fresh blood leading to a hatch into the basement. We need to continue our search down there."
"103224356-0-52290";"We found a secret passage in the Grinning Horker's basement. I should see where it goes and continue to look for the people who were lured here, as well as signs of the coven."
"103224356-0-52291";"Apparently, the Icereach Coven has taken the people they lured here deeper into the cavern. I should talk to Lyris and let her know we're on the right track."
"103224356-0-52292";"Lyris thinks this huge cavern is part of Blackreach, an old Nord legend about an underground world that supposedly stretches beneath all of Skyrim. I should take a look around and destroy any witch pikes while I wait for Lyris to catch up with me."
"103224356-0-52296";"My search of Blackreach turned up witch pikes, coven notes, and more references to the coven's leader, Sister Balra. She might be in the Dwarven ruins in the western portion of this underground expanse. I should search in that area."
"103224356-0-52297";"I found Lyris. I should tell her what I discovered down here in Blackreach."
"103224356-0-52298";"Lyris and I need to find the Icereach Coven leader, Sister Balra, and deal with her once and for all. She might be inside a nearby Dwarven ruin."
"103224356-0-52299";"The ruin was empty except for a wounded sentry from Windhelm. I should talk to him and find out what happened."
"103224356-0-52300";"With his last dying breath, the wounded sentry admitted to betraying his oath. Sister Balra stabbed him before leaving for Windhelm, where the sentry believes she means to assassinate King Jorunn. I should talk to Lyris."
"103224356-0-52301";"Lyris suggested we go to Windhelm immediately and make our way to the Palace of Kings. She wants to save Jorunn the Skald-King from the coven witch, Sister Balra."
"103224356-0-52302";"Now that I arrived in Windhelm, I should make my way to the Palace of Kings with Lyris so that we can warn Jorunn the Skald-King that he's in danger."
"103224356-0-52303";"Lyris wants me to talk to the housecarl so we can enter the Palace of Kings and find King Jorunn."
"103224356-0-52304";"The housecarl opened the Palace of Kings for me and Lyris. While the housecarl rallies the guards, we need to go inside and find the Skald-King."
"103224356-0-52305";"The Icereach Coven and its vampire allies have already infiltrated the palace. We need to find Jorunn the Skald-King and make sure he's all right."
"103224356-0-52306";"We need to continue our search for Jorunn the Skald-King in the palace dungeons."
"103224356-0-52313";"Sister Balra appears to be conducting some sort of dark ritual on Jorunn the Skald-King. Lyris and I need to put a stop to this before it's too late."
"103224356-0-52314";"I defeated Sister Balra and saved King Jorunn. Now I should head to the palace throne room and talk to the Skald-King."
"103224356-0-52315";"The Skald-King thinks that Western Skyrim might be in danger, but he needs to proceed carefully since they don't recognize his authority. In the meantime, he suggested I talk to Lyris."
"103224356-0-52316";"Both Lyris and the Skald-King fear that the Icereach Coven has designs on the holds of Western Skyrim. I should talk to Lyris and see how she wants to proceed."
"103224356-0-52332";"I freed Captain Mavvok from Maxten's clutches. I should talk to him and see how he and his crew are fairing."
"103224356-0-52336";"I need to go to the Blue Palace in Solitude and talk to Svana."
"103224356-0-52337";"My companions are discussing options with Swordthane Uthlet. I should listen to what they have to say."
"103224356-0-52338";"I need to enter Blackreach and find the site of the harrowstorm ritual beneath the city of Solitude."
"103224356-0-52339";"We reached a point in Blackreach that's approximately underneath the city of Solitude. I should talk to Lyris and see how she wants to proceed."
"103224356-0-52340";"Two paths lead into Greymoor Keep. I can cross the bridge to the main entrance, or I can sneak inside through a sluice gate on the eastern wall, provided I can acquire a key."
"103224356-0-52341";"Lyris wants us to split up and explore Greymoor Keep. We need to find the ritual site and disrupt it before the harrowstorm strikes the city above. I'll take Fennorian with me."
"103224356-0-52342";"Fenn noticed something as we made our way up into Greymoor Keep. I should ask him what he found."
"103224356-0-52343";"Fenn thinks the entire structure serves the same purpose as the witch pikes—it's a focus for a gigantic harrowstorm! We need to continue exploring the keep to find a way to stop the coming storm."
"103224356-0-52344";"High King Svargrim and Rada al-Saran are ascending through the tower of Greymoor Keep toward the city of Solitude above. We need to find a way to follow them."
"103224356-0-52345";"Svargrim is ascending through Greymoor Keep to Solitude, where he plans to unleash the harrowstorm. I need to follow him through the upper levels of Greymoor Keep."
"103224356-0-52346";"Lyris and I entered a gallery full of stone husks. We need to make it through here before any of these things come to life."
"103224356-0-52347";"Fennorian needs time to open the way to the keep's upper levels. I should help Lyris and Svana defend his position."
"103224356-0-52348";"Svana wants me to help her locate her father, High King Svargrim, on the upper levels of Greymoor Keep."
"103224356-0-52350";"The tunnels ahead should lead up to the surface. I should follow them."
"103224356-0-52351";"The tunnel ahead should lead to the surface. I should follow it and return to Solitude."
"103224356-0-52352";"Svana is discussing strategy with Lyris and Fenn. I should listen to their exchange."
"103224356-0-52353";"To stop the harrowstorm and save Solitude, I need to kill High King Svargrim."
"103224356-0-52354";"I should check on Svana and then we need to get back to Lyris and Fenn."
"103224356-0-52355";"Now that the immediate threat to Solitude is behind us, I should talk to Svana and see what else we need to do."
"103224356-0-52374";"Priest Bavian asked me to go to the Kilkreath Temple stables and look for Acolyte Hjolt, Priest Direnna, and Roligmolf the pilgrim."
"103224356-0-52375";"I found the three people Priest Bavian sent me in search of. Now I should meet her at the Pilgrims' Lodge, west of the temple, and tell her of their fates."
"103224356-0-52376";"I found Priest Bavian in the lodge with one of the acolytes. I should talk to Priest Bavian."
"103224356-0-52377";"I should enter Kilkreath Temple to search for High Priest Varkour."
"103224356-0-52378";"Vampires have invaded Meridia's temple. Priest Bavian wants to make sure any remaining temple priests are all right, so we need to search for them."
"103224356-0-52382";"Priest Bavian ran off. I should follow her."
"103224356-0-52383";"Priest Bavian ran off. I should talk to her and make sure she's all right."
"103224356-0-52385";"Priest Bavian thinks that High Priest Varkour went to the catacombs to secure a Meridia relic. I need to reach the chamberlain's sanctum and retrieve the key to open the door to the catacombs."
"103224356-0-52386";"I located the chamberlain's sanctum. I should look around and find the key that opens the door to the catacombs."
"103224356-0-52387";"Priest Bavian wants me to use the key and open the door to the catacombs."
"103224356-0-52388";"I need to search the catacombs and find High Priest Varkour and the relic called Meridia's Brilliance."
"103224356-0-52389";"High Priest Varkour has fallen to the same corruption as the rest of the priests and pilgrims. I need to retrieve the relic called Meridia's Brilliance."
"103224356-0-52390";"Now that I have the Meridian relic, I should follow Priest Bavian and exit the catacombs through the old airshaft."
"103224356-0-52391";"Priest Bavian asked me to meet her in the cave where all this began so I can present her with Meridia's Brilliance."
"103224356-0-52392";"I should talk to Priest Bavian and give her the relic known as Meridia's Brilliance."
"103224356-0-52399";"Priest Bavian met me near the door to the catacombs. I should talk to her before we proceed."
"103224356-0-52416";"Fenn's message indicated that he apparently found something important and returned to Dusktown to investigate. Lyris and I should look for him in the Blackreach mining settlement."
"103224356-0-52417";"We arrived at Fennorian's lodgings on the south side of Dusktown, but there's no sign of Fenn. I should look around and see if there's any indication of where Fenn may have gone."
"103224356-0-52418";"We didn't find Fenn but we did notice signs of a struggle in his lodgings. I should talk to Lyris about what we discovered."
"103224356-0-52419";"Fenn's notes mentioned he was going to meet with someone named Edjar at a camp east of the Dusktown bridge. I should look for this Edjar there."
"103224356-0-52420";"I agreed to finish what Fenn started and use the Dwarven key to set Edjar's pack mates free. I need to make my way to the work camp on the western side of the Lightless Hollow and unlock their chains."
"103224356-0-52421";"I should talk to Svana in her private chamber in the Blue Palace and tell her what we uncovered in Blackreach."
"103224356-0-52429";"Edjar directed Lyris and me to a hidden door. He says it leads to a Dwarven lift that will take us into the tower. Then he can ride it to the top and escape into the wilds of Western Skyrim."
"103224356-0-52430";"The crew of The Silver Cormorant are close to starving to death. I should gather meat for them so they have something to eat."
"103224356-0-52432";"I found a camp. I should look around and see if anything belonging to Rasir is near by."
"103224356-0-52434";"Brondold was investigating Icereach Coven activity on behalf of Lyris Titanborn. He was supposed to bring her his evidence at the Blue Palace in Solitude, but he never made it. I should look for Lyris at the palace and deliver Brondold's findings."
"103224356-0-52435";"I informed Lyris of Brondold's death just as Queen Gerhyld arrived. Lyris asked me to take Brondold's place and introduce myself to the queen."
"103224356-0-52436";"I informed the queen about what I learned from Brondold's documents. While she seems to believe us, she thinks we need more proof before High King Svargrim will trust an envoy from Jorunn the Skald-King. Now I should talk to Lyris."
"103224356-0-52437";"Lyris suggested we follow Brondold's leads. I need to search the back alleys for Greyga, a local snitch, and ask about the smugglers. Then I need to go to the Lonely Troll and ask Maugh if he knows what the Reachmen were up to."
"103224356-0-52438";"We learned that the smuggler Kasalla accepted smuggled goods at the docks and that a Breton working with Reachmen recruited half a dozen Nord laborers. I should talk to Lyris about which lead she wants to follow up on first."
"103224356-0-52439";"Lyris suggested we pay a visit to Kasalla's warehouse at the docks below Solitude and see what she's been smuggling into the city before we check on our other lead."
"103224356-0-52440";"A lone sentry guards Kasalla's warehouse. I should speak to him and see if I can convince him to let us into the warehouse."
"103224356-0-52441";"The sentry recognized Lyris. Turns out he's a huge admirer. He ran off to get an item for her to autograph. With him gone, I can pick the warehouse lock at my leisure."
"103224356-0-52442";"Kasalla's warehouse contains marked crates like the one I encountered on the docks. I should search these crates and see what's inside."
"103224356-0-52445";"I recovered some strange urns and Reach fetishes from the marked crates, but Kasalla has arrived. She seems willing to talk things out. I should speak with her."
"103224356-0-52446";"Kasalla smuggled the urns for an unnamed collector, but took on additional shipments recently that contained arcane materials. She mentioned that a Breton came by and took some of the crates to an abandoned lodge. I should discuss this with Lyris."
"103224356-0-52447";"Lyris wants me to go check out the abandoned lodge in the foothills north of the city. She's going to circle around and meet me there."
"103224356-0-52448";"I arrived at the remote lodge. I should look around for clues."
"103224356-0-52450";"The laborers and the shipment from Kasalla's warehouse weren't at the lodge, but I found a letter ordering the Breton to send ""the shipment"" on to Kilkreath Temple. I need to find Lyris and let her know."
"103224356-0-52451";"I met Lyris on the road not far from the lodge. I should speak to her about what I learned."
"103224356-0-52452";"While Lyris heads to Solitude to try again to warn High King Svargrim, I need to go to Kilkreath Temple."
"103224356-0-52453";"I was stopped by Fennorian on my way to Kilkreath Temple. I should talk to him."
"103224356-0-52454";"Fennorian asked me to help him examine the strange witch pikes erected around the perimeter of the temple."
"103224356-0-52456";"Fennorian spotted pilgrims leading a cart away from the temple before the storm struck. He wants to check that there were no members of the coven hiding among the pilgrims."
"103224356-0-52457";"Now it's time to head to Kilkreath Temple and see what additional damage the harrowstorm caused."
"103224356-0-52458";"We need to retrieve Fennorian's alchemical equipment, which he hid within a nearby copse of trees."
"103224356-0-52459";"Lyris caught up with us but thinks Fennorian is a threat. I should talk to her and introduce her to the House Ravenwatch agent."
"103224356-0-52460";"Lyris spotted an Icereach Coven witch called Sister Ambritt on the cliffs overlooking the temple. We need to get up there and catch her before she disappears."
"103224356-0-52461";"We found the Icereach Coven witch. We need to kill Sister Ambritt before she can summon another harrowstorm."
"103224356-0-52462";"We defeated the coven witch but Fennorian found something. I should follow him and see what he discovered."
"103224356-0-52463";"Fennorian led me to an altar of some sort. I should ask him what he found."
"103224356-0-52464";"Fennorian and I learned a lot here at the Kilkreath Temple. I should talk to Lyris and see if she thinks we have enough to take to the queen so she can convince High King Svargrim now."
"103224356-0-52465";"I should investigate the cavern Rasir mentioned in his journal to see if he's inside."
"103224356-0-52471";"I killed Hakgrym the Howler. Now, I should continue my journey deeper into the Unhallowed Grave."
"103224356-0-52472";"I encountered a door locked behind a glowing Pyre Watch ward. I should search for a way to open it."
"103224356-0-52473";"With the civilians safely returned, I should check in with Hafskjar."
"103224356-0-52476";"I need to enter the old barrow on the west side of town. Fenrar says I might find survivors there."
"103224356-0-52477";"I should search the barrow for any surviving townsfolk. Fenrar's brother Hafskjar escorted them there for safety."
"103224356-0-52478";"I found Hafskjar hiding alone inside the barrow. I should talk to him and learn about the rest of the survivors."
"103224356-0-52479";"Hafskjar told me Reachmen dragged the survivors deeper into the barrow. I need to follow their trail and find where they took the villagers."
"103224356-0-52480";"I found tunnels that the Reachmen mined through the caves beneath Karthwatch. I should follow them to see where they lead."
"103224356-0-52481";"The caves led to a Reachmen camp on the opposite side of the cliffs near Karthwatch. I need to find the captive civilians in the camp."
"103224356-0-52482";"A captured woman called out for help when she saw us. I should speak with her to find out more."
"103224356-0-52483";"Helsi told me the Reachmen took the townsfolk into the western tower and the Warleader has the key. I need to retrieve it in order to find the remaining captives."
"103224356-0-52484";"I found the tower key. I should enter the tower and free the captive townsfolk."
"103224356-0-52485";"I've freed the captives of Karthwatch, but Bjora is still missing. Helsi speculates that the Reachmen need her for a special purpose. I should see if I can find her."
"103224356-0-52486";"I found Bjora alone at the base of an ancient briarheart tree. I should see if I can speak with her to find out what's going on."

"103224356-0-52488";"Hafskjar believes the witches are using foul mind magic to convince Bjora to serve them. Disrupting the rituals may allow us to save her in time."
"103224356-0-52489";"Hafskjar believes killing the witches will free Bjora. I should go to the tree and check on Bjora."
"103224356-0-52490";"Bjora has been freed of the Icereach witches' spell and returned to Fenrar's camp. I should meet the rest of the survivors there."
"103224356-0-52492";"Rasir's cure worked on one of the afflicted. I must track him down to locate the remaining doses of the cure."
"103224356-0-52497";"I freed Edjar's pack. Now I should find him and Lyris south of the work camp and let him know I upheld Fenn's part of their bargain."
"103224356-0-52500";"Hafskjar fears the witches turned Bjora to their cause with foul mind magic. I need to kill the nearby witches to release their spell."
"103224356-0-52502";"I found Tranya badly wounded. I should talk to her to find out what happened."
"103224356-0-52504";"Skor chased Rasir through the Grotto. I need to get inside to follow them."
"103224356-0-52512";"I need to locate Rasir and save him from Skor."
"103224356-0-52513";"Rasir is alive. I should speak with him to assess his condition."
"103224356-0-52515";"There are wounded refugees inside the Grotto. I should give them the cure so they have a chance to survive."
"103224356-0-52521";"Edjar showed us how to get into Tzinghalis's tower, but the way ahead is blocked by a Dwarven door. I need to figure out how to open it before we can rescue Fennorian."
"103224356-0-52522";"We unsealed the Dwarven door. Now to search for Fennorian."
"103224356-0-52523";"We entered a netherroot garden full of Dwarven machines that spray a poison mist. I need to shut down those machines before we can cross the chamber and continue our search for Fenn."
"103224356-0-52524";"The laboratory contained some of Exarch Tzinghalis's research, but then we heard Fenn's tortured scream. We need to find him."
"103224356-0-52525";"We searched Tzinghalis's laboratory and netherroot garden. Now we need to keep going so we can find Fennorian."
"103224356-0-52526";"We killed Exarch Tzinghalis. Now I need to find a way to release Fennorian from that terrible machine."
"103224356-0-52527";"We found Fenn, but before we can help him, we need to kill Exarch Tzinghalis."
"103224356-0-52528";"Fenn explained that Exarch Tzinghalis and Rada al-Saran would often go into Tzinghalis's sanctum to discuss strategy. We should search it for any information about the Gray Host and what they may be planning."
"103224356-0-52529";"I need to bring the map and the communique back to the Blue Palace. Lyris and Fenn will meet me there."
"103224356-0-52530";"Fenn is free, but the torture he endured seems to have taken a toll on him. I should talk to him and give him the flask I found in his Dusktown lodgings."
"103224356-0-52533";"I convinced the guard to let me enter, so I should go inside before the auction ends."
"103224356-0-52534";"The auction has already started. I should talk to the Broker about the lute."
"103224356-0-52535";"I arrived too late. Someone already won the lute at auction. Luckily, the broker identified the winner as an obnoxious drunkard. I should look for this inebriated buyer."
"103224356-0-52538";"I should tell Leiborn I have the Petraloop."
"103224356-0-52539";"I obtained the Petraloop. I should return to Leiborn at the Bards College and inform him of my success."

"103224356-0-52542";"I should talk to Leiborn and collect my reward"
"103224356-0-52546";"I should find out more about the auction from Leiborn."
"103224356-0-52557";"We stopped Essenia and rescued Adusa. All that's left is to meet with Gwendis back at our original meeting place to ensure everyone is all right."
"103224356-0-52558";"I revealed Overseer Urlvar's deception to Elle. I should speak with Claudina about our success."
"103224356-0-52559";"Talk to the buyer's servant to collect the Petraloop."
"103224356-0-52560";"Phebe asked me to set up a few spirit traps in the area and gave me a list of specific locations that her mentor, Claudina, marked."
"103224356-0-52561";"Go to Collector's tower and steal the instrument."
"103224356-0-52562";"The lute already sold at auction. I need to figure out a way to acquire the instrument. I could negotiate with the buyer, or take it by less legal means."
"103224356-0-52571";"The settlement's leader, Elle Bitterblade, seems to have lost her patience for Claudina and Phebe. Perhaps I can smooth things over by delivering news that the traps are complete."
"103224356-0-52572";"I met the two ghost hunters, Claudina Ildene and Phebe Peronard. They seem to be intent on helping the miners rid this place of evil spirits. I've been asked to help set up spirit traps around Blackreach in order to capture them."
"103224356-0-52580";"I should look around to see if I can find any sign of the caravan or what might have happened to it."
"103224356-0-52586";"I found a ruined caravan and some suspicious items. I should meet up with Captain Hingrid at the overlook and report on what I found."
"103224356-0-52587";"I should report my findings to Captain Hingrid and see how she wants to proceed with the investigation."
"103224356-0-52588";"Ena keeps a number of camps across the overlook. I should search around and see if I can figure out where she's gone."
"103224356-0-52589";"Captain Hingrid wants me to investigate the location Ena mentions in her letter. I should see if I can find any sign of Ena at her camp by the waterfall upriver."
"103224356-0-52590";"Reachmen overrun the camp. I should see if Ena is in the camp."
"103224356-0-52591";"Now that I set her free, I should talk to Ena White-Eye and find out what she knows."
"103224356-0-52592";"I need to warn Captain Hingrid about the Reachmen's planned attack."
"103224356-0-52593";"Ena returned to town, but something's wrong. I should talk to her and find out what."
"103224356-0-52594";"I need to gather kindlepitch and fire salts from the garrison barn. With those ingredients, I can make explosives to seal the side entrance bolt holes before the Reachmen can use them to attack the garrison."
"103224356-0-52595";"I stopped the Reachmen's plot to destroy the bridge at Dragon Bridge. Now I should check in with Captain Hingrid."
"103224356-0-52596";"I should talk to Phebe about the traps."
"103224356-0-52597";"Elle asked me to investigate the place where the missing town guard was last seen. Hopefully, there will be some kind of clue to his whereabouts within."
"103224356-0-52598";"It seems the whistle might have attracted something after all. There's strange rattling coming from the second floor. I should investigate."
"103224356-0-52599";"The mysterious rattling basket held only a cat and a note.  I should see if this letter has any information we can use."
"103224356-0-52600";"I gathered the kindlepitch and fire salts. Now I can use them to make explosives and seal the side entrance bolt holes before the Reachmen can use them to attack the garrison."
"103224356-0-52601";"I closed both bolt holes to prevent the Reachmen from attacking the garrison. Now I need to find the main entrance to the smuggler caves behind the waterfall."
"103224356-0-52602";"I need to defuse the Reach explosives before Vund can collapse the caverns. I should also try to rescue Ena's partner, Ulang, if I happen to see him."
"103224356-0-52603";"I stopped the Reachmen's plot to destroy the bridge at Dragon Bridge. Now I should check in with Captain Hingrid."
"103224356-0-52606";"We discovered a way into Greymoor Keep's undercroft. Gwendis and I should hurry inside before Lady Essenia discovers us."
"103224356-0-52607";"We entered Greymoor Keep. Now we must begin our search for Gwendis's sister, Adusa-daro."
"103224356-0-52608";"Gwendis and I discovered a vault filled with vampiric prisoners, but no sign of Adusa. I should speak with Gwendis about our next course of action."
"103224356-0-52609";"Gwendis urged me to find a mechanism that will allow us to free the vampiric prisoners. I should try to find a way up to the balcony overlooking the pens."
"103224356-0-52610";"I found the release mechanism. Pulling the lever should free the prisoners below."
"103224356-0-52611";"I should talk to the prisoner, Arlof. Hopefully he has some useful information about Adusa's whereabouts."
"103224356-0-52612";"Arlof informed us that Essenia took Adusa to a laboratory for further experiments. Apparently, it lies somewhere beyond the Blood Queen's arboretum."
"103224356-0-52613";"We discovered a secret door hidden behind a bookshelf. We should move through this hidden passage to continue our search for Adusa."
"103224356-0-52616";"Gwendis asked to speak with me. I should talk to her before we go any further."
"103224356-0-52617";"Lady Essenia waits deeper inside the laboratories. I need to deal with her. Hopefully, she hasn't already inflicted a terrible fate upon Adusa."
"103224356-0-52620";"The contents of the letter point to a possible location for the missing town guard, Captain Ageran. I should tell Claudina what I discovered, since Phebe was scared off."
"103224356-0-52621";"Claudina and I need to investigate the location mentioned in the note."
"103224356-0-52623";"I should try using the Spirit Warding Whistle that Phebe gave me to see if it gets the attention of whatever is in the cave."
"103224356-0-52624";"Using the whistle elicited a strange noise from inside the cave. I should investigate further."
"103224356-0-52625";"Investigating the location in the note led us to Captain Ageran's body and Overseer Urlvar. We need to find out what Overseer Urlvar knows."
"103224356-0-52626";"Whatever killed Captain Ageran can't have gone far. I should see if I can track it down."
"103224356-0-52627";"We examined the witch pikes set up around the perimeter of the temple. I should talk to Fennorian and discuss what we learned."
"103224356-0-52631";"Whatever killed Captain Ageran definitely went down into the mines. We should follow it."
"103224356-0-52633";"Claudina and I overheard Overseer Urlvar talking to a vampire. It appears the two of them are working together. I should talk to Claudina about what to do next."
"103224356-0-52636";"I made it into Overseer Urlvar's office. I should look around to see if I can find anything incriminating."
"103224356-0-52637";"The note I found proves that Overseer Urlvar is working with a vampire. It also seems to suggest that the vampire is the one responsible for the missing miners. I should talk to Claudina and tell her what I discovered."
"103224356-0-52638";"I need to locate the vampire before he goes into hiding again."
"103224356-0-52639";"wWe've spotted the vampire, but he's moving fast through the mines. We need to follow him without being seen."
"103224356-0-52640";"The vampire keeps turning into a strange mist to evade us. I should talk to Claudina and see if she has any ideas about how to catch him."
"103224356-0-52641";"I extinguished all the Reachmen's ritual pyres. I should inform <<1>> of my success."
"103224356-0-52642";"I should enter Shadowgreen and extinguish the Reachmen's ritual pyres."
"103224356-0-52643";"I need to find and extinguish the Reachmen's ritual pyres in the Shadowgreen before they can succeed in their plans."
"103224356-0-52648";"I should find Gwendis and speak with her."
"103224356-0-52650";"I told Alwyn that her ancestor shouldn't be held responsible for his lover's betrayal. I should speak to her about what she intends to do with his remains."
"103224356-0-52653";"If I have anything else to discuss with Lyris, I should do it now before we go to see the queen."
"103224356-0-52655";"Lyris wants me to meet her in Solitude so that we can present what we found at Kilkreath Temple to Queen Gerhyld."
"103224356-0-52657";"I should head to the Blue Palace and meet up with Lyris before we present ourselves to Queen Gerhyld."
"103224356-0-52658";"I found a medallion among the shattered glass beneath a broken window the assassin may have escaped through. I should show the medallion to Lyris and see what she makes of it."
"103224356-0-52659";"Lyris wants to confront High King Svargrim and try to get him to listen to reason. I should follow her."
"103224356-0-52660";"Lyris intimidated our way into High King Svargrim's chamber. Now we need to talk to him and convince him of the danger posed to his kingdom by the Icereach Coven."
"103224356-0-52661";"High King Svargrim refuses to believe us. He thinks this might be a trick perpetrated by Jorunn the Skald-King. He demanded we leave and Lyris obliged. I should follow her."
"103224356-0-52662";"Princess Svana approached us as we exited Svargrim's chamber. I should speak with her."
"103224356-0-52666";"Old Mjolen's divination spell requires the following reagents: deathbell and wolf bones. I can find both in the bog around Morthal."
"103224356-0-52672";"I reached the assassin's hideout just as he was about to finish off Fennorian. Luckily, the assassin decided to flee rather than deal with the both of us. I should check on Fenn and make sure he's all right."
"103224356-0-52674";"Fenn asked me to search the assassin's hideout for clues he left behind. I should take a look around."
"103224356-0-52678";"I found a map and a few documents left behind by the vampire assassin when he fled. I should discuss their contents with Fennorian."
"103224356-0-52679";"I should follow the map and meet up with Lyris at the entrance to the mine."
"103224356-0-52680";"Lyris, Fennorian, and I need to explore the old mine and see if we can find any sign of the vampire assassin."
"103224356-0-52681";"We followed scaffolding down into the depths of the mine and found a massive cavern. I should talk to my companions about this place."
"103224356-0-52682";"Fenn spotted the vampire assassin and a coven witch. He's going to follow them while Lyris and I destroy the witch pikes they set up in preparation for their harrowstorm ritual."
"103224356-0-52684";"Lyris and I agreed to split up and investigate the mining town for signs of the vampire assassin while Fenn searches the cavern outside the town. I should speak to a few of the locals and find out what's going on down here."
"103224356-0-52685";"Other than learning that Dusktown is part of the Bitterblade Mining Consortium, I didn't find out much. No one's seen the vampire assassin, though. I should see if Lyris discovered anything."
"103224356-0-52687";"We need to meet up with Fenn on the far side of town and see what he's learned during his scouting."
"103224356-0-52688";"Fennorian spotted the queen's assassin and a coven witch flee into a nearby Dwarven ruin called Kagnthamz. He asked me to meet him and Lyris there. I should head inside and wait for them to catch up."
"103224356-0-52689";"Now that Lyris and Fenn have arrived, we should search the ruins for the vampire assassin and his coven witch ally."
"103224356-0-52690";"Sister Tharda is performing some sort of ritual and she isn't alone. Fenn wants to observe the event for a moment before we act."
"103224356-0-52691";"The witch's ritual caused a werewolf to emerge from a stone husk. The werewolf and the vampire departed, but left the witch to stop us. We need to kill Sister Tharda."
"103224356-0-52692";"We killed Sister Tharda, but the werewolf and vampire got away. Lyris and Fenn ran off in pursuit. I should go after them."
"103224356-0-52693";"I need to catch up with Lyris and Fenn and see if they spotted the vampire and the werewolf that were talking to Sister Tharda."
"103224356-0-52694";"While Lyris and Fenn take another look at the Icereach witch's ritual site and those stone husks, I need to return to Solitude and let Princess Svana know that we killed the assassin who murdered her mother, the queen."
"103224356-0-52695";"Svana wants to know more about the Icereach Coven and the threat they pose to her kingdom. I should tell her what I know."
"103224356-0-52706";"Phebe's whistle worked. Claudina and I need to follow the vampire."
"103224356-0-52708";"I recovered the Karthald Crown. I should present it to Magister Fridelja and tell her what happened to the jarl."
"103224356-0-52709";"Phebe's spirit whistle might affect the vampire. I should use it and see if it helps us locate him."
"103224356-0-52710";"The trapdoor led into the mines, which are off limits to us. Staying out of sight will make it easier to investigate."
"103224356-0-52711";"I need to sneak into Overseer Urlvar's office to find evidence of him working with the vampire. To do that I, either need to steal his key or pick the lock on the door."
"103224356-0-52723";"The vampire ran into a nearby cave. I should investigate and see if I can find any proof of Overseer Urlvar's plot within."
"103224356-0-52725";"I found a list of targeted victims in the vampire's hideout. This should be enough proof for Elle. I should find her and present this evidence."
"103224356-0-52727";"Elle won't believe us without proof. I should show her the evidence we collected."
"103224356-0-52731";"We finally cornered the vampire assassin who killed the queen. Time to make him pay for his crime."
"103224356-0-52733";"The queen's assassin is dead, but the Icereach witch Fenn saw is still at large. The assassin called her Sister Tharda. We should continue searching the ruin and try to find her."
"103224356-0-52739";"I should talk to Alwyn now that we've recovered all of Jarl Hagridden's scattered remains."
"103224356-0-52740";"I told Alwyn that her ancestor bears some responsibility for what happened to his soldiers, even if he didn't betray them himself. I should speak to her about what she intends to do with his remains."
"103224356-0-52746";"Svana is reflecting on our battle with Svargrim on the battlements of Castle Dour. I should speak to her now that the threat has passed."
"103224356-0-52747";"Svana asked me to check on Lyris and Fennorian. We left them in the courtyard of Castle Dour to hold out against a horde of harrowfiends while we faced Svargrim. Hopefully, they survived."
"103224356-0-52748";"Lyris and Fennorian survived their battle with the harrowfiends. I should see how they fared."
"103224356-0-52749";"Jorunn the Skald-King, High King of Eastern Skyrim, has arrived at the gates of Solitude. It's unclear what his intentions are. I should head to the gates and see what the commotion is about."
"103224356-0-52750";"Lyris asked me to talk to Jorunn the Skald-King and try to peacefully solve this diplomatic situation."
"103224356-0-52751";"I need to report Fennorian's progress on the elixir to Svana. She said she would be holding a gathering in the Blue Palace courtyard. I should meet her there."
"103224356-0-52752";"I should speak to Svana so she can begin her ceremony."
"103224356-0-52754";"Viggol's wife, Telline, asked me to find Viggol and keep him safe. I should hurry to catch up to him."
"103224356-0-52755";"I found Viggol in the caverns with his dog. I should speak to him."
"103224356-0-52756";"Viggol survived the creatures pursuing him. I should speak to him."
"103224356-0-52762";"I joined Viggol's adventure. He plans to find a group of missing miners. His dog, Pickle, picked up a trail of some kind. We should follow him."
"103224356-0-52763";"This looks like where the miners set up camp. I should look around for more clues as to what happened here."
"103224356-0-52764";"I found a journal from one of the miners. It looks like the miners were being hunted by something, perhaps the creatures from the rumors? I should tell Viggol what I learned."
"103224356-0-52765";"We should follow Pickle and see if he can pick up another trail that might lead us to the missing miners."
"103224356-0-52766";"We've reached a collapsed bridge leading to an old Dwarven ruin, but there doesn't appear to be a way across."
"103224356-0-52767";"Pickle is on Viggol's trail. I need to stay close."
"103224356-0-52768";"Pickle found one of the wounded miners. I should speak with him about what happened to the others in his group."
"103224356-0-52769";"Pickle picked up Viggol's trail again. I should follow."
"103224356-0-52770";"I found Viggol. I should tell him what I learned."
"103224356-0-52771";"Viggol wants to find us an escape route out of Lightless Hollow. My job is to locate the other miners and free them. We'll meet up when we're both finished."
"103224356-0-52772";"I found the captured miners in a pen. I should free them."
"103224356-0-52773";"Viggol has a way to get the locked door open. I need to be ready to pull the lever when he gives the signal."
"103224356-0-52774";"We managed to escape, but more of the creatures attacked and Viggol stayed behind to hold them off. Right now, I should focus on getting out of the mine."
"103224356-0-52775";"We escaped Lightless Hollow, but Viggol didn't make it out. I should talk to Telline and tell her what happened."
"103224356-0-52776";"I need to tell Telline what happened to Viggol."
"103224356-0-52777";"Viggol survived Lightless Hollow. I should talk to him and ask him how he managed to escape."
"103224356-0-52784";"I found the entrance to the stronghold and ventured inside. There is no sign of the captain or the Silver Comorant's crew. They must be held deeper within the ruins."

"103224356-0-52801";"I posted the handbills for the salskap. I should inform Leiborn."
"103224356-0-52803";"I might need a tool to help me navigate the cliffs and crevasses of the Unhallowed Grave. I should look around to see if I can find a grappling bow."
"103224356-0-52806";"We found more dead priests and pilgrims near the entrance to Kilkreath Temple. I should talk to Fennorian and find out what he thinks happened here."

"103224356-0-53941";"The shade spoke in riddles. I should discuss what the tormented creature told me with Verandis."
"103224356-0-53942";"We need to continue our pursuit of Rada al-Saran and Lady Belain. Verandis wants to find them before they reach this so-called Dark Heart."
"103224356-0-53943";"We located Rada al-Saran and Lady Belain. They're in the chamber below us. I should listen in on their conversation."
"103224356-0-53944";"I should talk to Verandis and discuss what we just heard in the exchange between Rada al-Saran and Lady Belain."
"103224356-0-53945";"According to Lady Belain, a Reach witch prophecy is somehow involved in their plan to awaken the Dark Heart. Verandis wants me to return to Rebel's Retreat and see what Arana can tell us about the topic."
"103224356-0-53946";"Lady Belain wants Nathari and the Ghostsongs to awaken the Dark Heart of their prophecy. Arana needs to get inside the Lost Valley barrow to stop Nathari from doing something terrible. We need to make our way to the barrow entrance."
"103224356-0-53947";"Arana wants to know what the letter I found in the Gray Host camp has to say. I should talk to her and let her know that it appears Nathari is working with Lady Belain for some reason related to the dark prophecy."
"103224356-0-53948";"The sigils lead to what Gwendis believes is an entrance to the Gray Host hideout. Once she finds a way inside, we can investigate."
"103224356-0-53949";"I should talk to Count Verandis Ravenwatch and let him know Ard Caddach's response."
"103224356-0-53950";"Arana is returning to prepare her rebels for war. I should find Verandis and determine what we should do next."
"103224356-0-53961";"Gwendis told me I can find Verandis in Markarth, in Understone Keep. I should talk with him."
"103224356-0-53962";"Rada al-Saran's forces are gathering to the north of Markarth, near Bthardamz. Verandis asked me to investigate and discover the Gray Host's plans."
"103224356-0-53963";"I heard Rada al-Saran addressing his forces as I approached the Gray Host camp. I should try to find him."
"103224356-0-53964";"Lyris and Fennorian confronted Rada al-Saran as I approached, but the Ashen Lord and his commanders escaped without a fight. I should speak to Lyris and Fenn about what they're doing here."
"103224356-0-53965";"Rada al-Saran escaped, but Fennorian intercepted a coded communication important to the Gray Host. We should bring it to Verandis in the orrery chamber of the Library of Arkthzand in Blackreach."
"103224356-0-53966";"I should talk to Verandis about the Gray Host's intercepted message and what it means for us."
"103224356-0-53968";"The coded letter directed Verandis to three different locations. I should investigate each site in order to determine more about Rada al-Saran's ultimate plan."
"103224356-0-53969";"I recovered an Oblivion stone from the sundered land in the Reach, the Nighthollow Testament, and an unassembled keystone. I should return to the orrery chamber and see what Verandis makes of all this."
"103224356-0-53970";"Despite the others badgering Verandis about his past, I need to show the count what I found and see if these items help us get closer to determining Rada al-Saran's plans."
"103224356-0-53971";"Verandis said that Rada al-Saran has a hidden laboratory somewhere in the Library of Arkthzand, but he hasn't been able to pinpoint it. He asked all of us to help him search for it."
"103224356-0-53974";"Verandis thinks he can stop the Darkstorm, but he needs to enter Rada al-Saran's sanctuary realm to do so. I should ask him how we can do that."
"103224356-0-53993";"The notice directed me to talk to <<1>> in the Reach city of Markarth for more details."
"103224356-0-53994";"I should ask <<1>> how I go about picking up one of these daily jobs."
"103224356-0-53997";"Gwendis asked me to meet Verandis at Nighthollow Keep, an ancient vampire fortress in Blackreach. The Dark Heart may be hidden somewhere inside."
"103224356-0-53998";"I met Verandis on the way to Nighthollow Keep. I should talk to him."
"103224356-0-53999";"As we search Nighthollow Keep, Verandis wants me to look for personal objects that he can use his auramancy on to get impressions of what happened here and how it relates to the Dark Heart."
"103224356-0-54000";"I wandered into an old study in Nighthollow Keep. I should search it for something Verandis can use to attempt to draw a memory from."
"103224356-0-54001";"I found a damaged insignia of some sort in the keep's study. I should ask Verandis whether this is a suitable target for his auramancy."
"103224356-0-54002";"Verandis thinks he can coax a memory from the emotional aura clinging to this insignia. I should observe anything that appears."
"103224356-0-54003";"The memory conjured from the insignia showed Lady Belain and another Nighthollow vampire talking about drinking from the Dark Heart. I should see what Verandis thinks of this revelation."
"103224356-0-54005";"Verandis wants me to continue to explore. While the magic he cast on the damaged insignia might reveal more memories, he wants me to find an undamaged one. He also suggested the place may contain void portals that will help me navigate the keep."
"103224356-0-54006";"I found a relatively undamaged portion of the keep. It looks like a noble's personal chamber. I should search the area for objects that Verandis can cast his auramancy upon."
"103224356-0-54007";"I should watch and see what memory Verandis can draw from the insignia with his auramancy magic."
"103224356-0-54008";"I observed another Nighthollow memory conjured by Verandis's aurumancy. I should talk to Verandis about this latest memory."
"103224356-0-54010";"Verandis and I learned that the Nighthollow vampires accessed the Dark Heart through a passage they called the Dark Halls. I should continue to explore the keep in search of this passage."
"103224356-0-54012";"The way is open. Now to explore the Dark Halls and see if we can find the Dark Heart."
"103224356-0-54013";"Verandis wants me to use the intact insignia and see if it opens the way to the Dark Halls."
"103224356-0-54014";"It appears that when the Dark Heart began to slow many centuries ago, Lady Belain took the last of the power for herself. I should talk to Verandis about this."
"103224356-0-54017";"The lift took me to an overlook across from the Library of Arkthzand. The orrery dome is now glowing. I should talk to Verandis."
"103224356-0-54023";"We reached the chamber containing the Dark Heart, but Rada al-Saran and Lady Belain are already here. While Verandis attempts to stop Rada al-Saran, I need to keep Lady Belain's Nighthollow minions away from him."
"103224356-0-54024";"Verandis and I found a small shrine deep in the Dark Halls. The personal items left here seem to be good candidates for his auramancy. I should watch whatever memory Verandis is able to reveal."
"103224356-0-54026";"The Dark Heart has awakened. I should talk to Verandis and find out what we should do now."
"103224356-0-54027";"I need to follow Verandis and leave the Dark Heart chamber."
"103224356-0-54029";"I should meet Gwendis at Ravenwatch Castle and let her know I'm ready to travel to the secret island called Grayhome."
"103224356-0-54030";"Gwendis and I need to travel to the secret island of Grayhome, using the map on the back of Rada al-Saran's letter to Verandis. The journey begins with the cart waiting for us at Ravenwatch Castle."
"103224356-0-54031";"We arrived on the secret Gray Host island. I should speak to Gwendis and find out what she wants to do now."
"103224356-0-54032";"Gwendis wants to survey the island for traps and wildlife before we approach the castle. I should follow her."
"103224356-0-54033";"We discovered an odd-looking crystal. When Gwendis approached, it pulsed. I should ask her what she thinks about this."
"103224356-0-54034";"Gwendis believes I successfully deactivated the first crystal. She thinks she sees more up ahead. I need to deactivate those as well before we can safely enter the castle."
"103224356-0-54035";"When I deactivated the last crystal, there was an audible rumble. We should check the front door and see if we can enter the castle now."
"103224356-0-54036";"We entered the ancient Gray Host castle. I should talk to Gwendis about where we should begin our search."
"103224356-0-54037";"I must drink the dream-walk potion mixed with a vial of Verandis Ravenwatch's blood so I can experience Verandis's memories of this place and discover the truth of his connection."
"103224356-0-54038";"My journey through Verandis's memories begins. I arrived at the castle. The steward instructed me to speak with Verandis's fellow exarchs while his study is prepared."
"103224356-0-54039";"My journey through Verandis's memories continues. As Verandis, I spoke with both Exarch Ulfra and Exarch Tzinghalis. Now, I need to seek out Rada al-Saran."
"103224356-0-54040";"My journey through Verandis's memories continues. The steward moved Verandis's personal belongings to the study prepared for him. I should find it and see what clues it might hold."
"103224356-0-54041";"My journey through Verandis's memories continues. I entered Verandis's study. Now I should read Verandis's journal. Maybe they will give me more insight into his connection to the Gray Host."
"103224356-0-54042";"I attempted to read Verandis's notes, but could not. I heard Gwendis call out to me from the real world. I should find the dream-walk potion in the dream and drink it to wake up."
"103224356-0-54043";"I exited the dream-walk. Now I should tell Gwendis what I learned about Verandis and his ties to the Gray Host."
"103224356-0-54044";"In Verandis's memories, there was a journal in his study. I need to find the same study in the present and see if the ancient journal is still there."
"103224356-0-54045";"Verandis's journal mentions a ritual involving stone husks. Apparently, when he attempted the ritual on a mortal, it drove her mad. I should tell Gwendis what I learned."
"103224356-0-54046";"Gwendis wants to use Verandis's ritual to try to resurrect a member of the Gray Council so she can interrogate them. I need to find the reliquary Verandis filled with some of his life essence and hid in the armory."
"103224356-0-54047";"I found Verandis's reliquary. Now I should meet Gwendis in the ritual chamber."
"103224356-0-54048";"Gwendis prepared all elements of the ritual while I gathered the reliquary. I should do whatever she tells me to complete the ritual."
"103224356-0-54049";"The ritual seems to be working. I should get ready for whatever happens next."
"103224356-0-54050";"The vampire we resurrected is mad with hunger. Gwendis and I must subdue him before he kills us both."
"103224356-0-54051";"I should give Gwendis and Verandis a moment to catch up."
"103224356-0-54052";"I should head out of the ritual chamber and see what Count Verandis has to say."
"103224356-0-54053";"I should speak to Count Verandis Ravenwatch and learn what I can about all that transpired."
"103224356-0-54054";"I should speak to Gwendis about everything we learned during our investigation."
"103224356-0-54055";"Now that we finished investigating the Gray Host and Verandis's connection to them, I need to give Gwendis and Verandis time to catch up and figure out our next move against Rada al-Saran. I should see if she needs anything else in the meantime."
"103224356-0-54056";"I disrupted the witch matron's ritual, and freed her captives. Now I should claim my reward."
"103224356-0-54057";"I should find the witch matron and disrupt her ritual. I also need to rescue any Reachfolk she plans to sacrifice."
"103224356-0-54060";"I need to find and retrieve the talismans worn by the Wildblood warriors."
"103224356-0-54061";"I gathered the Wildblood talismans that <<1>> requested. I should deliver them to him and claim my reward."
"103224356-0-54069";"When I locate a harrowstorm ritual site, I need to destroy the witch pikes and gray reliquary in order to disrupt the harrowstorm ritual."
"103224356-0-54070";"I disrupted a harrowstorm ritual. I should return to <<1>> to report my success."
"103224356-0-54074";"When I locate a harrowstorm ritual site, I need to destroy the witch pikes and gray reliquary in order to disrupt the harrowstorm ritual."
"103224356-0-54077";"I disrupted a harrowstorm ritual. I should return to <<1>> to report my success."
"103224356-0-54083";"I found an undamaged insignia in the Nighthollow suite. I should ask Verandis to try his auramancy magic on this new insignia."
"103224356-0-54090";"I reactivated the orrery and opened a gateway through the Void. Hopefully, it will lead to Rada al-Saran's sanctuary realm."
"103224356-0-54091";"I emerged from the gateway into a strange Oblivion realm, but I'm alone. I should see if Lyris and Verandis made it through as well."
"103224356-0-54092";"Gwendis wants me to get to the orrery chamber in the Library of Arkthzand and offer my assistance to Verandis."
"103224356-0-54093";"I heard Lyris nearby. She sounded like she was in trouble. I should find her."
"103224356-0-54094";"I reunited with Lyris in Oblivion, but Verandis wasn't with her. We should search for him."
"103224356-0-54095";"Lyris and I spotted the Darkstorm forming in the distance. There's a good chance that's where we'll find Rada al-Saran, and possibly Verandis as well."
"103224356-0-54096";"Verandis defied Rada al-Saran and was nearly killed. I need to protect Verandis and end Rada al-Saran's existence once and for all."
"103224356-0-54097";"Rada al-Saran is dead. Verandis is attempting to take control of the Darkstorm. I should wait for him."
"103224356-0-54098";"Verandis opened a gateway to the orrery with the power of the Dark Heart. Lyris and I should return there while we still have the chance."
"103224356-0-54099";"Lyris wants to talk to me. I should speak to her."
"103224356-0-54100";"Lyris suggested I head back to Markarth to confirm our suspicion that the lives lost to the Dark Heart have been restored. She'll meet me there."
"103224356-0-54101";"Lyris and I have discovered that Verandis resurrected the lost souls of Markarth, returning the people killed by the Gray Host to life. I should talk to her about this development."
"103224356-0-54102";"I should be able to use the strange shard we found to propel us through the void portals. With any luck, we can use them to find a way into the Library of Arkthzand."
"103224356-0-54107";"With the last ward dispelled, I should head through the door and try to find the Dark Heart."
"103224356-0-54114";"We located Rada al-Saran's hidden laboratory. There are many experiments left inside. I should speak to Verandis about it."
"103224356-0-54115";"Verandis claims to understand how Rada al-Saran's experiment is intended to work, but he still doesn't understand the purpose. He believes Rada intended for him to repeat his work to discover what his true aims are. Verandis needs my help to succeed."
"103224356-0-54127";"To complete the Vateshran's Rites, I must clear the three wings that each represent a Daedric Prince, what the Reachfolk refer to as the great spirits. Once I defeat every enemy, I may move on."
"103224356-0-54128";"I overcame the challenges of the Vateshran's Rites. I should talk to the Rites Matron to receive my reward."
"103224356-0-54137";"<<1>> gave me a whistle and told me to use it to summon <<2>>. She said if I find <<2>>, I might find <<3>>, too."
"103224356-0-54138";"I should make sure Bolfalgar and Snowy can get back to Hiretta on their own before I take my leave."
"103224356-0-54139";"<<1>> came running as soon as I blew the whistle. I should praise <<1>> and tell her she's a good girl so she'll trust me."
"103224356-0-54140";"<<1>> wants me to follow her. Maybe she'll lead me to <<2>>."
"103224356-0-54143";"The wards around Karthwasten have been restored. I should speak with <<1>>."
"103224356-0-54144";"Apprentice Fialyn asked me to speak with Shaman Ulvoch. She wants him to explain the ward restoration process, after he approves of my presence."
"103224356-0-54145";"Shaman Ulvoch asked me to help Apprentice Fialyn gather materials to present as offerings at the wards. I need to gather willow branches, moon-touched stones, and cicada husks."
"103224356-0-54151";"Gwendis thinks this crystal might be part of some sort of ward protecting the castle. She's seen something like this before. She asked me to try to deactivate the crystal."
"103224356-0-54152";"I gathered the various materials for the offerings. Now to take them to the wards and place them while Apprentice Fialyn says the prescribed words."
"103224356-0-54155";"I need to go to an Undaunted Enclave in Elden Root, Mournhold, or Wayrest to find out more about what they want me to do for a cut of their plunder."
"103224356-0-54156";"I should finish my conversation with the Undaunted liaison."
"103224356-0-54157";"Adusa-daro wants me to meet her down below in the Dwarven ruins so we can find Kathad. The lift should descend into the cavern that houses the ruins of Reachwind Depths."
"103224356-0-54158";"I should talk to Adusa-daro and ask about her plan for entering the Reachwind Depths Ruins."
"103224356-0-54159";"Adusa wants me to find an old sluice gate and use that to get inside the ruins the locals call the Reachwind Depths."
"103224356-0-54160";"I entered the Dwarven ruins. Now I need to find a place where I can observe Adusa-daro's confrontation with the leader of the Lothid clan, Boss Trenlor."
"103224356-0-54161";"I found a place that overlooks Boss Trenlor's court. I should observe as Adusa talks to him."
"103224356-0-54162";"Boss Trenlor had Adusa-daro tossed into the Deep Tombs. Adusa said that if that happened, it would be up to me to find her and rescue her."
"103224356-0-54163";"I found Adusa-daro in the Deep Tombs. I should talk to her."
"103224356-0-54164";"Adusa-daro wants to search the Deep Tombs and locate Kathad. I should help her find him."
"103224356-0-54165";"We found Kathad in a storage chamber with another vampire. Adusa wants me to talk to him."
"103224356-0-54166";"Kathad refuses to leave until he helps Freyleth accomplish her plan to overthrow Boss Trenlor and provide a new direction for the Lothid clan. I should talk to Freyleth and learn about this plan."
"103224356-0-54167";"Kathad won't leave until he's sure the clan has a new leader. I agreed to help Freyleth accomplish her plan by acquiring a mushroom that grows in the Blinds, the caverns beneath the Deep Tombs. She can use the mushroom to weaken Boss Trenlor."
"103224356-0-54168";"This huge section of the Blinds seems the likely place to find a darkcap mushroom. I should look around."
"103224356-0-54169";"I gathered the darkcap mushroom for Freyleth. Now I need to find the lift that leads to the servant's quarters so I can meet Kathad and Freyleth."
"103224356-0-54170";"Adusa wants to talk before we meet with Kathad and Freyleth."
"103224356-0-54172";"I found the lift that Freyleth mentioned. I should use it so I can meet her and Kathad in the servant's quarters."
"103224356-0-54173";"We found Kathad and Freyleth in the servant's quarters. I should talk to him."
"103224356-0-54174";"Kathad gave me a disguise so I can blend in as one of Boss Trenlor's servants. I should put it on before I leave this chamber."
"103224356-0-54175";"Now that I'm wearing the disguise, I need to sneak past the clan vampires and reach Boss Trenlor's court so I can drop the darkcap mushroom into his chalice of blood."
"103224356-0-54176";"Now that I reached Boss Trenlor's court, I should place the darkcap mushroom in his chalice of blood."
"103224356-0-54177";"I placed the darkcap mushroom in Boss Trenlor's chalice of blood. Now I should take the chalice and present it to him."
"103224356-0-54178";"I should give the chalice of blood tainted with the darkcap mushroom to Boss Trenlor."
"103224356-0-54179";"I should wait and see what the blood tainted with darkcap mushroom does to Boss Trenlor."
"103224356-0-54180";"Freyleth lied to us. The darkcap mushroom didn't weaken Boss Trenlor. It killed him! I should talk to her and get an explanation."
"103224356-0-54181";"After Freyleth tricked us into poisoning Boss Trenlor and took over the Lothid clan, Adusa left in disgust. I should meet her outside."
"103224356-0-54182";"I helped Adusa-daro convince Kathad to leave the Lothid clan. I should talk to her."
"103224356-0-54186";"Verandis has asked me to go to Markarth and warn Ard Caddach. Instead of fighting back against the Gray Host, he needs to fall back and deny as many lives as possible to the Dark Heart."
"103224356-0-54187";"I should let Bradan know that the Gray Host wants a fight. They want to kill everyone to feed the Dark Heart. He needs to make sure Markarth's defenders work to keep everyone alive and not try to die in a blaze of glory."
"103224356-0-54188";"Now that I reached Understone Keep, I should find Ard Caddach and let him know the true purpose of this assault on Markarth."
"103224356-0-54189";"Now that I brought Bradan up to speed, I need to go to Understone Keep and convince Ard Caddach and Arana that we need to deny the Dark Heart as many deaths as we can."
"103224356-0-54190";"Ard Caddach explained that Arana chased Lady Belain back into Nchuand-Zel. I should try to catch up to them and help the witch-rebel defeat the ancient vampire."
"103224356-0-54191";"I entered the undercity of Nchuand-Zel. Now to find Arana and help her deal with Lady Belain."
"103224356-0-54192";"I found Arana, but she appears to have been seriously wounded. I should talk to her."
"103224356-0-54193";"Arana was seriously wounded in her battle with Lady Belain, but she thinks she sensed the presence of another keystone in the Nchuand-Zel vaults below. I need to find that keystone so I can enter the orrery chamber in the Library of Arkthzand."
"103224356-0-54194";"I located the Nchuand-Zel Keystone, but it's protected by ancient Dwarven wards. I need to figure out a way past the defenses so that I can get the keystone and enter the Library of Arkthzand."
"103224356-0-54195";"Now that I have a keystone, I can access the orrery inside the Library of Arkthzand. I should head there and make my way to the orrery chamber."
"103224356-0-54196";"I reached the Library of Arkthzand and met Verandis, who has been seeking a way into the orrery chamber. I should tell him about the keystone I acquired in Nchuand-Zel."
"103224356-0-54197";"It's time to use the keystone I acquired in Nchuand-Zel and enter the orrery chamber in the Library of Arkthzand."
"103224356-0-54198";"We killed Lady Belain, kept the Dark Heart from devouring all of Markarth, and scattered the Gray Host. But Rada al-Saran escaped. I should ask Verandis what we should do now."
"103224356-0-54201";"I should finish up my conversation with the Undaunted liaison."
"103224356-0-54203";"We entered the orrery chamber to find Rada al-Saran doing something to the arcane machine. We need to try to stop him."
"103224356-0-54204";"While Verandis and Gwendis attempt to stop Rada al-Saran and whatever he's doing with the orrery above, Lady Belain teleported me down below into the chamber with the Dark Heart. She's drawing power from it. I need to stop her while I still can."
"103224356-0-54205";"With her dying breath, Arana opened a portal to return me to the orrery above. She said that Verandis needs my help. I should hurry through the portal."
"103224356-0-54206";"We powered down the orrery. I should let Verandis know what transpired in the Dark Heart chamber below."

"103224356-0-54213";"I arrived in the village of Karthwasten. I should speak with <<1>>."
"103224356-0-54214";"The sentry mentioned that the ard's soldiers have been called back to Markarth because Caddach feels the rebels are a bigger threat to the city than the Gray Host. I should explore east of the city and see what I can learn."
"103224356-0-54217";"I learned that the rebels may be gathering in the foothills east of Markarth, that someone named Arana may be their leader, and that the rebels are hunting the Gray Host. Now I should go to Understone Keep and find Verandis."
"103224356-0-54218";"I should approach the throne and share what I learned with Ard Caddach, the Despot of Markarth. Hopefully, this conversation will help us gain a better understanding of the Gray Host's plans for the region."
"103224356-0-54219";"Ard Caddach asked me to speak to his advisor, Lady Belain. He wants me to help her find the rebel leader Arana before he agrees to meet with Count Verandis."
"103224356-0-54220";"Lady Belain wants me to search for Arana and the rebels in the foothills to the east of Markarth. A favor for a favor, as she said."

"103224356-0-54222";"I came across an encampment that may belong to Arana's rebels. A sentry noticed me and called out. I should talk to him."
"103224356-0-54224";"Tayfaern, a member of Arana's rebels, wants me to investigate a few Gray Host stockpiles and tell him what they're storing there. If I perform this favor, he might introduce me to Arana."
"103224356-0-54225";"The Gray Host stockpiles contained gray reliquaries and witch pikes. I also found a letter that mentioned a gathering circle, northwest of Valthume Barrow, where a spy meets with the Gray Host. I should investigate before I return to the rebel camp."
"103224356-0-54228";"As I prepared to leave the ruin, the rebel witch, Arana, appeared. I should speak with her."
"103224356-0-54230";"A note in the gathering circle confirms that Lady Belain is working with the Gray Host, and Arana revealed that Belain is also a vampire. I need to go to Valthume and observe a meeting between her and the Gray Host leader."
"103224356-0-54231";"I arrived at the barrow called Valthume. Now I need to find Lady Belain and the Gray Host leader."
"103224356-0-54232";"I found Lady Belain speaking to the leader of the Gray Host. I should observe from the shadows to learn their plans."
"103224356-0-54233";"Rada al-Saran, the leader of the Gray Host, sensed my presence. He requested that I follow him. This might be my only opportunity to see what he has to say."
"103224356-0-54236";"I should return to Ard Caddach's throne room in Understone Keep to tell Count Verandis and Ard Caddach what I learned about Lady Belain and the Gray Host's plans."

"103224356-0-54242";"I met Arana at the path leading into Lost Valley. She found a Gray Host scout who she thinks Bradan dealt with on his way inside. I should talk to her."
"103224356-0-54249";"The Dark Heart released its energy as we returned and we suddenly found Arana among us, alive and well. I should speak to her."
"103224356-0-54250";"I need to find the tools the Thornroot shamans use to turn their captives into briarhearts and destroy them."
"103224356-0-54253";"I destroyed the Thornroot shamans tools. I should return to <<1>> and claim my reward."
"103224356-0-54267";"I should find the lair of the Thornroot clan's hagraven matron and take her totem."
"103224356-0-54270";"I retrieved the hagraven matron's totem. I should return this to <<1>>."
"103224356-0-54271";"I should go to Understone Keep in Markarth to inform Ard Caddach of Rada al-Saran's death."
"103224356-0-54272";"Braden told me Ard Caddach is holding an audience in his war room. I should find him there to tell him about Rada al-Saran's death."
"103224356-0-54273";"Ard Caddach wants me to attend an address that he and the other leaders of Skyrim will give to the people of Markarth. I should find him in his audience chambers."
"103224356-0-54274";"Ard Caddach wants to speak with me before he and the leaders of Skyrim announce their intentions to cooperate."
"103224356-0-54276";"Ard Caddach appears to be hosting a moot with the rulers of Eastern and Western Skyrim and they reached some kind of agreement. Ard Caddach wants to speak with me."
"103224356-0-54294";"I completed the three wings of Vateshran Hollows. I must now enter the Champion's Circle and complete the final challenge."
"103224356-0-54296";"We need to find Nathari before she sacrifices any more of the Ghostsong clan members."
"103224356-0-54297";"The offerings have been placed at the wards. I should return to Karthwasten and inform Shaman Ulvoch that everything is ready for him to perform the restoration ritual."
"103224356-0-54305";"Despite leaving Verandis behind in Rada al-Saran's sanctuary realm, he's appeared to speak with me. I should find out how he was able to return."

"103224356-0-54326";"Something went wrong during the ritual. I should speak to Shaman Ulvoch and find out what we need to do next."
"103224356-0-54329";"The note next to the Ghostsong clan hunter contains the final words of Senan. He died fighting instead of allowing himself to be sacrificed. I should inform Arana."
"103224356-0-54339";"Verandis suggested that a local scrap dealer named Nolovan might be able to help us get a lead on the Arkthzand Keystone. While I find him in the southeast section of the city, Verandis plans to meet with Arana and the rebels."
"103224356-0-54340";"Now that I'm inside Nolovan's Scrap House, I should ask the proprietor about the Arkthzand Keystone."
"103224356-0-54341";"Nolovan thinks I may be able to find the Arkthzand Keystone in the ruins of Bthar-Zel. He has a map, but I need to buy it or complete a simple job for him to obtain it."
"103224356-0-54352";"As I was leaving the scrap house, Gwendis of the Ravenwatch showed up. I should talk to her."
"103224356-0-54353";"Gwendis told me that Verandis made contact with Arana's rebels. She wants me to join him at the Reachfolk's main encampment, Rebel's Retreat."
"103224356-0-54354";"I should talk to Shaman Ulvoch now that the offerings have been placed at the wards."
"103224356-0-54356";"Shaman Ulvoch doesn't know why the ritual failed, but suspects it might have something to do with the ritual pyre itself. I need to try and find a clue as to what went wrong."
"103224356-0-54362";"I arrived at Rebel's Retreat. Verandis wants me to talk to Arana. I should speak to her."
"103224356-0-54363";"Arana intends to conduct a ritual to seek the blessing of Hircine for our alliance. I need to gather the components she needs for the ritual—a briarheart seed, a hagraven's eye, and bright river-shale."
"103224356-0-54364";"I gathered the ritual components as Arana requested. I should return to Rebel's Retreat and deliver them to her."
"103224356-0-54365";"I found the components of a plant at the ritual site. I should report my findings to Apprentice Fialyn."
"103224356-0-54369";"Apprentice Fialyn thinks the source of the corrupted plant may lie in the Sanuarach Mine beneath Karthwasten. We need to go into the mine and investigate."
"103224356-0-54374";"Apprentice Fialyn and I made it inside the mine and found the corrupted plant. I should speak with her about what we should do next."
"103224356-0-54377";"I should place the components into the fire to begin Arana's ritual."
"103224356-0-54381";"The map I acquired in Markarth indicates that three locations hold the secret to finding the entrance to Bthar-Zel. Arana and I should go to these locations and look for clues."
"103224356-0-54388";"I think Arana may have figured out how to interpret the map. I should talk to her."
"103224356-0-54389";"Arana told me where to find the entrance to Bthar-Zel. I should make my way to the hidden entrance."
"103224356-0-54391";"Arana and I must enter Bthar-Zel to look for the Arkthzand Keystone while Verandis and Gwendis search another section of the ruin."
"103224356-0-54397";"We located the entrance to Bthar-Zel, but it appears to be locked behind some sort of elaborate lock. I must solve this puzzle to enter the Dwarven ruin."
"103224356-0-54400";"We entered the Dwarven ruin of Bthar-Zel. Verandis and Gwendis went off to search on their own. Now Arana and I need to see if these ruins really contain the Arkthzand Keystone."
"103224356-0-54401";"Fialyn wants to burn all traces of the plant. We also need to destroy support pillars to secure the mine and make sure the Gray Host can no longer use it to farm the plant."
"103224356-0-54404";"The plants are destroyed and the mine has been damaged enough to make it unusable by the Gray Host. I should return to Karthwasten so the shaman can complete the ritual of restoration for the wards."
"103224356-0-54405";"I should speak with Shaman Ulvoch and tell him that it should be safe to perform the restoration ritual now."
"103224356-0-54407";"As before, Shaman Ulvoch asked me to present myself at a pyre during the ritual. Hopefully now that Apprentice Fialyn and I destroyed the corrupted plants, the ritual will be successful."
"103224356-0-54410";"It seems the restoration ritual was a success. I should talk to <<1>>."
"103224356-0-54413";"I should continue my search for the Arkthzand Keystone in Bthar-Zel."
"103224356-0-54414";"Verandis and Gwendis encountered Rada al-Saran and Lady Belain. Unfortunately, I'm too far away to intervene. I should watch to see what happens."
"103224356-0-54416";"We exited Bthar-Zel, but Lady Belain wound up with the Arkthzand Keystone. I should talk to Arana and see what she thinks we should do now."
"103224356-0-54417";"Rada al-Saran and Lady Belain snatched the keystone away from Verandis and Gwendis, which triggered some sort of alarm. Now I must fight an enormous Dwarven automaton to escape Bthar-Zel."
"103224356-0-54423";"Gwendis found a way into the Gray Host hideout. I should follow her."
"103224356-0-54424";"Gwendis and I need to search for clues inside Viridian Watch about the Gray Host survivor."
"103224356-0-54425";"Gwendis found strange sigils that can only be seen by vampires and werewolves in Viridian Watch. This must be a clue to where the rumored survivor found refuge. I should speak to Gwendis about the sigils."
"103224356-0-54428";"Verandis felt a great pain and says that Rada al-Saran is drawing on the power of the Dark Heart. We have to get to the orrery chamber as fast as we can."
"103224356-0-54429";"I found Rada al-Saran in the orrery chamber. He seems to be performing the same ritual we just did but on a grander scale. I must try to stop him."
"103224356-0-54430";"We succeeded in recreating whatever it was Rada al-Saran did here. It seemed to have had a profound impact on Verandis. I should speak to him about what he discovered."
"103224356-0-54431";"<<1>> led me to <<2>>. I should talk to him and make sure he's all right."
"103224356-0-54432";"Now that we solved the problem here in Gloomreach, I should speak to Psijic Calis about what happens next."
"103224356-0-54433";"Psijic Calis asked me to accompany him to investigate the strange plant life inside the cave."
"103224356-0-54435";"At the entrance to the Dark Halls Verandis conjured an old memory of Rada al-Saran and Lady Belain discussing the Dark Heart. I should talk to Verandis about this latest memory."
"103224356-0-54436";"Verandis and I have found the passage to the Dark Halls, but the way is blocked by powerful magic. Verandis wants to try to draw a memory from this location with his auramancy. I should watch and see what happens."
"103224356-0-54440";"We need to transport the relic back to Artaeum before it causes more damage. I should deactivate any of the Dwemer Amplifiers I see."
"103224356-0-54443";"I need to reactivate the orrery to open the gateway to Rada al-Saran's sanctuary realm."
"103224356-0-54444";"Psijic Calis identified pockets of tonal disturbance inside the cave. We need to contain these disturbances before they get any worse."
"103224356-0-54454";"Verandis encouraged me to begin my investigation by speaking with the nearby Reach sentry. She might give me an idea as to what type of information Ard Caddach would consider important enough to meet with us about."
"103224356-0-54458";"Verandis is wrestling with the Darkstorm, but he hasn't dispelled it. I should speak with him."
"103224356-0-54461";"The arsonist responsible for destroying the Grand Archive seeks the same book as Eveli. To continue my pursuit, I must eliminate Captain Geminus."
"103224356-0-54462";"Eveli chased after Pyroturge Encratis to reach the book's location before he does. I should go after them."
"103224356-0-54464";"With Pyroturge Encratis's death, Eveli has the book she came here to collect. I should speak to her."
"103224356-0-54465";"I found Pyroturge Encratis. I should kill him before he can remove the book that Eveli pursues."
"103224356-0-54466";"Eveli asked me to scout ahead in the villa for any trouble. I should enter through the sewer grate and explore the grounds."
"103224356-0-54467";"In my search through Black Drake Villa I discovered an enormous Minotaur blocking the path. I need to kill Kinras Ironeye to contiunue forward."
"103224356-0-54468";"I entered the Grand Archive. I should explore it with Eveli to find the book she seeks."
"103224356-0-54469";"I should talk to Eveli Sharp-Arrow about what she's doing at Black Drake Villa."
"103224356-0-54472";"I need to complete Black Drake Villa."
"103224356-0-54473";"I defeated foes in Black Drake Villa.\n\nI should find <<1>> in my alliance's capital city."
"103224356-0-54474";"<<1>> presented me with another challenge: plant the Undaunted Banner before fighting Pyroturge Encratis."
"103224356-0-54475";"<<1>> is waiting to speak to me once again in my alliance capital."
"103224356-0-54476";"Urgarlag Chief-bane is waiting to speak to me once again in my alliance capital."
"103224356-0-54478";"<<1>> is waiting to speak to me once again in my alliance capital."
"103224356-0-54480";"I found Taskmaster Viccia, but there is no sign of Drathas's father. I should kill the Taskmaster to keep searching."
"103224356-0-54481";"Lyranth caught up to let us know that the captives were taken to a Mehrunes Dagon shrine further ahead. I should move past the Lava Caves to find it."
"103224356-0-54482";"Lyranth was taken by Baron Zaudrus. I should look for her in the Mehrunes Dagon shrine."
"103224356-0-54483";"We killed Baron Zaudrus and rescued Drathas's father. I should talk to Lyranth about my promised reward."
"103224356-0-54484";"The path is blocked by the Molten Guardian. I should kill it to continue ahead."
"103224356-0-54485";"Lyranth suggested I clear the way so Drathas can continue the search for his family. I should move deeper into the mine."

"103224356-0-54508";"I need to stop the Reach clan's witch matron from performing the dangerous ritual. I should also recover any notes of hers I can find so that the Stonehands can destroy them."
"103224356-0-54511";"I disrupted the witch matron's ritual and closed the void tears.I should return to Markarth for my reward."

"103224356-0-54570";"Lyris asked me to go to Gloomreach and help Sai Sahan look for the third letter between the vampire leaders of the Gray Host. He thinks it contains clues to a connection between Rada al-Saran, a Reach hero, and Sai's martial tradition."
"103224356-0-54571";"I found a concealed chamber hidden in the depths of Gloomreach Cavern. I should see what's inside."
"103224356-0-54573";"Sai Sahan entered the concealed chamber after I recovered the third letter he and Lyris were looking for. I should talk to him."
"103224356-0-54575";"Lyris thinks she knows what the song is trying to tell us. I should ask her if Sai Sahan knows what he needs to do next to claim his spirit sword."
"103224356-0-54591";"I examined the strange vegetation. I should speak to Psijic Calis and find out what he thinks is going on here."
"103224356-0-54592";"Psijic Calis believes he can sense Master Pythis's magic here. I should look around to see if I can find any clues he might have left behind."
"103224356-0-54595";"It looks like this gathering circle has seen recent use. There's a letter on the table. I should read it."
"103224356-0-54602";"Chief-of-Chiefs Cannear asked me offer my blessing to Eslyn and Madearn. I should find them in the handfasting cave to the north of Hroldan Ring."
"103224356-0-54603";"I went to the handfasting cave to offer the couple a blessing, but Eslyn and Madearn weren't there. I should see if I can locate any clues as to where they may have gone."
"103224356-0-54604";"Eslyn and Madearn left a note for the chief-of-chiefs that suggests they abandoned the handfasting and ran away. I should let Chief-of-Chiefs Cannear know."
"103224356-0-54605";"Chief-of-Chiefs Cannear asked me to find Eslyn and Madearn and convince them to return to Hroldan Ring. She suggested I search north of Hroldan Ring for them."
"103224356-0-54606";"I found Eslyn and Madearn. I should speak with them."
"103224356-0-54607";"Eslyn and Madearn think if they find a way to end the feud between their clans, they won't need to go through with the handfasting. We need to find a vateshran to learn more about the feud's origin."
"103224356-0-54608";"I found the camp, but the vateshran is nowhere to be seen. The intended couple thinks he's been captured by the Thornroot clan and taken into the nearby ruins. I need to search the ruins to find him."
"103224356-0-54609";"I found the vateshran tied up in Briar Rock Ruins. I should free him."
"103224356-0-54610";"Vateshran Barth wants me to guide him out of the Briar Rock Ruins to safety."
"103224356-0-54611";"Now that I safely escorted the vateshran out of the ruins, I should speak with him."
"103224356-0-54612";"Vateshran Barth agreed to tell me more about the origin of the Six-Ford and Eagleseer feud. I should meet him back at his camp to speak with him further."
"103224356-0-54613";"I made it back to the vateshran's camp. I should speak with him about the feud now."
"103224356-0-54614";"Eslyn and Madearn think they can resolve their clans' feud by repairing an ancient heirloom, the Lover's Coil. I should search the Karthspire Lea for a fragment of it."
"103224356-0-54615";"I made it to Karthspire Lea. I should look around for a fragment of the Lover's Coil."
"103224356-0-54616";"I found the fragment of the Lover's Coil just as Madearn appeared at Karthspire Lea. I should speak with him."
"103224356-0-54617";"Madearn wants me to find Eslyn. I should head to Faolan's Ire where she went to search for the other fragment of the Lover's Coil."
"103224356-0-54618";"I found Eslyn, but she needs help recovering the Lover's Coil fragment at Faolan's Ire. It's currently inside a Giant's camp. I should see if I can retrieve it."
"103224356-0-54619";"I retreived the Lover's Coil fragment from the Giant camp. I should let Eslyn know."
"103224356-0-54620";"I should meet Eslyn, Madearn, and Vateshran Barth near Hroldan Ring."
"103224356-0-54621";"Now that Chief-of-Chiefs Cannear knows the story of the Lover's Coil, I should speak with her and inform her of Eslyn and Madearn's plan to end the feud in lieu of the handfasting."
"103224356-0-54622";"I decided to support Eslyn and Madearn and not force them to go along with the handfasting, despite objections from Chief-of-Chiefs Cannear. I should speak to Eslyn and Madearn about my decision."
"103224356-0-54623";"I should watch Eslyn and Madearn present the restored Lover's Coil to their clans at Hroldan Ring."
"103224356-0-54624";"The clan chiefs weren't convinced by Eslyn and Madearn's appeal. I should speak with Vateshran Barth about the future of the Six-Ford and Eagleseer clans."
"103224356-0-54625";"I decided to convince Eslyn and Madearn to go through with the handfasting. I should speak with them about my decision."
"103224356-0-54627";"I should watch Eslyn and Madearn complete the handfasting rite at Hroldan Ring."
"103224356-0-54628";"Eslyn and Madearn completed the handfasting rite, ensuring an end to their clans' feud. I should speak with Vateshran Barth about the future of the Six-Fords and Eagleseers."

"103224356-0-54648";"I located Master Pythis's journal. I should speak to Psijic Calis about what it contains."
"103224356-0-54650";"We found the third letter, but it didn't provide the details Sai Sahan needs to understand how Faolan Red Eagle helped Rada al-Saran regain his Shehai. I need to go to Red Eagle Redoubt and find a vateshran who may know more of the tale."
"103224356-0-54652";"At Red Eagle Redoubt, a vateshran noticed me and asked what I seek. I should talk to her."
"103224356-0-54654";"Lyris and Sai arrived at the redoubt. I should let them know what the vateshran told me."
"103224356-0-54655";"I need to find the cave beneath the redoubt. Lyris and Sai will meet me after she talks to the vateshran."
"103224356-0-54656";"Lyris thinks the dense foliage may be hiding the secret we came to this cave to learn. I should burn it away."
"103224356-0-54659";"Lyris thinks she understands what the ancient song is trying to tell us. I should talk to her."
"103224356-0-54660";"I found the Undaunted Enclave. There's an Undaunted liaison here. I should speak to her."

"103224356-0-54696";"I should stand back as Arana performs the ritual."
"103224356-0-54697";"After waiting for a rescue that didn't come, Falkfyr headed west from the Dwarven door to search for high ground. I should start by searching for any prominent overlooks west of the northern door into Blackreach."
"103224356-0-54698";"Falkfyr made it safely to a good vantage point, where he left another parchment note. I should read it and see where he went next."
"103224356-0-54699";"Low on provisions, Falkfyr was forced to venture into the chaurus-infested wilds and make for the river to the north. He needed to find a safe place to refill his canteen. I should search the riverbank for another note."

"103224356-0-54701";"Falkfyr found water. He also learned that the chaurus would leave him alone if he was smeared in chaurus ichor. However, he still lacked food, so he headed to the nearby ruins to forage. I should look there next."
"103224356-0-54702";"I found another of Falkfyr's notes outside the Dwarven ruins. He made it this far, at least. I should read the note and learn what happened next."
"103224356-0-54703";"Falkfyr failed to find food in the Dwarven ruins, and he was forced to eat Blackreach mushrooms to survive. Luckily, they didn't poison him. Refreshed, he set off for a grove of fungal trees to the south. I should look there for his next note."
"103224356-0-54704";"Falkfyr left another note in an odd grove of fungal trees. I should see what it says."
"103224356-0-54705";"Falkfyr's latest note was a jumble of strange words and phrases. Perhaps eating mushrooms affected his mind. The note mentioned something he called the Great Oom off to the south. I may find out more if I head in that direction."
"103224356-0-54706";"I found yet another note left by Falkfyr. This one lies at the base of one of Blackreach's giant mushrooms. I should read it and see if it offers a clue as to where Falkfyr went next."
"103224356-0-54707";"Falkfyr's latest note was odd and disturbing. A steady diet of Blackreach mushrooms clearly affected him, but he mentioned a new home to the north … and treasure. I should see if he left something behind."
"103224356-0-54708";"I found one last note, an abandoned backpack, and a skeleton, likely Falkfyr's. Hopefully, this last note will offer some insight into the state of his mind at the end."
"103224356-0-54709";"Falkfyr's last notes were the ravings of a madman. He seemed to believe that he was a spore and that he would grow into an oom. Despite his grim fate, there may be treasure and other spoils left in his pack. I should see what I can find."
"103224356-0-54724";"Another member of the Order came to Psijic Calis's aid. The two of them safely secured the relic. I should speak to Psijic Calis now that the danger has past."

"103224356-0-54769";"Angair told me to find his clan mate Caddgarn in Vateshran Hollows if I wish to perform the Rites. I should go there and speak to him."

"103224356-0-54961";"The floor plate seems to have done something, but it didn't open the door that Lady Laurent expected it to. I should talk to her and see how she wants to proceed."
"103224356-0-54962";"Lady Laurent has sent me with a Stibbons duplicate to find a way to open the main doors. She expects I'll need to use the duplicate to activate another floor plate switch. I should look for the blue fire and make sure Stibbons follows me."
"103224356-0-54963";"I activated a number of floor plates and an ancient switch in the south wing. I should return to the first hall and see if that opened the main doors."
"103224356-0-54964";"Lady Laurent wants me to explore the north wing and find more floor plates for the Stibbons duplicates to stand on. I should look for the blue fire and make sure Stibbons follows me."
"103224356-0-54965";"I activated a number of floor plates and an ancient switch in the north wing. I should return to the first hall and see if that opened the main doors."
"103224356-0-54966";"I returned to the first hall. I should talk to Lady Laurent."
"103224356-0-54967";"Stibbons is trapped inside the sorcerous voriplasm. I need to find a way to take down the shield and get him out of there."
"103224356-0-54968";"I rescued Stibbons and broke the curse. The sorcerous voriplasm is destroyed. Now I should return to the first hall with Lady Laurent and her manservant."
"103224356-0-54969";"Stibbons is free and the sorcerer has been destroyed. I should speak to Lady Laurent in the Glenbridge Xanmeer."
"103224356-0-54970";"Lady Laurent and I need to make our way to the sorcerer's chamber to save Stibbons and undo the curse."
"103224356-0-54978";"The messenger delivered a letter from his mysterious patron. He referred to her only as the Dread Lady. I should read the letter and see what this Dread Lady wants with me."
"103224356-0-54980";"I arrived at the location marked on my map. I should enter the delve and see if I can find Lyranth somewhere inside."
"103224356-0-54981";"I came upon the Dremora known as Lyranth, who appears to have been trying to get information out of a Daedric cultist. I should talk to her and find out what this is all about."
"103224356-0-54982";"Lyranth wants me to explore the annex, deal with any additional protective wards I may find, and loot any caches inside the complex."
"103224356-0-54983";"I removed the protective wards on the Imperial caches and discovered three intriguing items: a map, a schematic, and a sealed scroll. I should take them back to Lyranth and show her what I found."
"103224356-0-54984";"Lyranth opened a portal that should get me close to the location marked on the Grahtwood map, the Ayleid ruin called Ne Salas. While she tries to unravel the mystery of the Emperor's scroll, I should investigate the ruin."
"103224356-0-54985";"Eveli Sharp-Arrow suggested I look for the Imperial cache and clear a path while she escorts the Wood Elves she's been helping to safety."
"103224356-0-54986";"This annex appears much larger than the one we found in the other ruin. Plus, it's crawling with Daedric cultists! I should look around and try to find a way to the Imperial cache."
"103224356-0-54988";"Somehow Eveli was able to break the ward even after the amulet failed. Lyranth arrived, but she wants me to see what's inside the cache before I talk to her. I should search it."
"103224356-0-54989";"Now that I'm close to Elden Root, I should find the camp where Eveli said we could meet her contact."
"103224356-0-54990";"Now that Beragon has deciphered the coded scroll, I should discuss the contents of it with Eveli."
"103224356-0-54991";"The letter claims to be from a Dremora who calls herself Lyranth. Says she needs my help. That the fate of the world depends on it. When I read the letter, it magically marked a location on my map. I should travel to this location and find Lyranth."
"103224356-0-54992";"The letter claims to be from a Dremora who calls herself Lyranth. Says she needs my help. That the fate of the world depends on it. When I read the letter, it magically marked a location on my map. I should travel to this location and find Lyranth."
"103224356-0-54993";"The letter claims to be from a Dremora who calls herself Lyranth. Says she needs my help. That the fate of the world depends on it. When I read the letter, it magically marked a location on my map. I should travel to this location and find Lyranth."
"103224356-0-55008";"We defeated Vandacia and the Waking Flame, and we stopped Mehrunes Dagon from claiming a portion of Blackwood for the Deadlands. I should talk to Eveli about what comes next."
"103224356-0-55009";"I should discuss plans with Eveli before I go inform the Ambitions."
"103224356-0-55010";"Before I head out to gather allies to defend Fort Redmane, I need to tell Sombren and the twins about our plans."
"103224356-0-55011";"I need to go to Leyawiin and see if Captain Rian is willing to send the Ivory Brigade to help defend Fort Redmane. In addition, if I know anyone else who can help, I should attempt to recruit them."
"103224356-0-55016";"Recruit Commander Axius"
"103224356-0-55017";"Recruit Brigadine Lieutenant Viria"
"103224356-0-55018";"Recruit the Three Winds"
"103224356-0-55020";"I gathered allies from other parts of Blackwood. Time to speak to Eveli and see how our defense of Fort Redmane is shaping up."
"103224356-0-55021";"It seems we're ready to defend Fort Redmane and protect the Ambitions. I should report to Governor Keshu and see where she wants me for the coming battle."
"103224356-0-55024";"Governor Keshu asked me to guard the Ambitions and serve as the fort's last line of defense. I should head inside before Vandacia and his cultists arrive."
"103224356-0-55025";"As I entered the fort, Captain Rian and Eveli began discussing the current situation. I should listen in."
"103224356-0-55026";"Vandacia's forces are opening portals to assault the courtyard, as expected. I need to support Captain Rian and the Ivory Brigade while Eveli escorts the Ambitions to the guardhouse."
"103224356-0-55027";"Now that the courtyard is secure, I should join Eveli and the Ambitions at the guardhouse."
"103224356-0-55028";"Vandacia's forces have infiltrated the guardhouse! I must help Eveli defeat the invaders. But where are the Ambitions?"
"103224356-0-55029";"Eveli and I cleared the guardhouse, but the Ambitions ran to the west. I should try to find them."
"103224356-0-55030";"I need to find Sombren and the twins. They ran west, deeper into the guardhouse. I should follow after them."
"103224356-0-55031";"I found the Ambitions in the inner bailey. I need to defend Sombren and the twins from any attack."
"103224356-0-55032";"I need to defend Sombren and the twins from Vandacia's forces as we make our way through the inner bailey."
"103224356-0-55033";"Vandacia killed Destron and used the released energy to begin to merge Fort Redmane with the Deadlands. Sombren and Calia fled into the fort's keep. I should follow them."
"103224356-0-55034";"I followed Sombren and Calia into the keep, but it's already occupied by Vandacia's forces. We'll need to deal with them before we can proceed."
"103224356-0-55035";"Sombren thinks he can use Eveli's book to stop Vandacia and Mehrunes Dagon. He needs me to find Vandacia and keep him busy until he's ready. We think Vandacia went to the courtyard."
"103224356-0-55036";"We found Vandacia in the courtyard of Fort Redmane, along with his master, Mehrunes Dagon. I need to keep him busy until Sombren can drain his energy and we can actually defeat him."
"103224356-0-55037";"We defeated Vandacia and the realms are separating once more. I should listen to what Mehrunes Dagon has to say before he is pulled back into the Deadlands."
"103224356-0-55038";"We defeated Vandacia and saved Fort Redmane. I should follow Sombren and Calia outside, though I might want to talk to Eveli and Elam before I go."
"103224356-0-55039";"Now that the battle is over, I should check on Sombren and Calia."
"103224356-0-55048";"I made sure Sombren and Calia were all right. Now I should check in with Eveli and report to Governor Keshu."
"103224356-0-55049";"The remaining councilors have gathered in Leyawiin Castle for their own protection. I should ask Councilor Lovidicus about the coded documents Eveli and I recovered from Councilor Jirich and Sophus."
"103224356-0-55050";"Councilor Lovidicus suggested Eveli and I speak with Keshu the Black Fin in Gideon. She may know what natural landmark the term ojel-bak refers to. I should tell Eveli what we need to do."
"103224356-0-55055";"We learned more about the origin and purpose of the Ambitions, even if we didn't get the twins the training they needed to control their power. The danger is momentarily diverted due to whatever Xynaa did to them. I should report to Governor Keshu."
"103224356-0-55058";"Councilor Jirich was attacked and she died shortly after I found her. But Eveli Sharp-Arrow has arrived. I should talk to her."
"103224356-0-55061";"In her rage and grief, Calia just wiped out the cultists! She's close to losing control, but at least Eveli has caught up to us. Sombren's trying to calm her down. I should listen."
"103224356-0-55070";"Elam Drals of the Dark Brotherhood thinks the owner of Amnis Manor is in league with Vandacia. I should enter the manor and look around."
"103224356-0-55071";"We found three of the Ambitions. I should meet Eveli at the governor's mansion and discuss our next steps."
"103224356-0-55073";"I should return to the village and talk to Nuxul."
"103224356-0-55074";"I agreed to investigate the feud between the Imperial soldiers and the Argonian tribe as a neutral party. I need to speak to the Imperial prisoner and find out what he knows."
"103224356-0-55075";"I should speak with Heem-Jas now that things are resolved."
"103224356-0-55077";"The invitation said I could speak to <<1>> to have an official bout with King Boar, but it also suggested I could just show up an participate. I should head to Hammerdeath Arena either way."
"103224356-0-55078";"I defeated King Boar in the arena. I should see <<1>> for my reward."
"103224356-0-55081";"I agreed to help search for the Golden Anvil. I should enter Zenithar's Abbey."
"103224356-0-55082";"Arbitrator Gavos Douar is finally freed from his wrongful imprisonment and the Golden Anvil rediscovered by the Resolutes of Zenithar. I should speak to Daluion about what comes next."
"103224356-0-55089";"I spoke with the Imperial lieutenant. Now Olik wishes to speak to me."
"103224356-0-55090";"Heem-Jas and I need to pick up the investigation where the Imperial lieutenant left off. Hopefully, we can find clues and determine what's actually going on here."
"103224356-0-55091";"We found a large spill of ritual dye. It looks as though someone ran through the spill. We should follow the footprints to see if they lead us to another clue."
"103224356-0-55093";"We reached a large totem. Heem-Jas seems worried about something. I should speak with him."
"103224356-0-55094";"Heem-Jas believes this totem is a lure and the magic of it caused creatures to emerge from the swamp. We need to destroy it."
"103224356-0-55095";"I tried to destroy the lure, but it didn't work. I should speak to Heem-Jas about what to do next."
"103224356-0-55096";"Heem-Jas believes that we must speak with Naheesh Nurwul about how to destroy the lures. I need to return to the tribe and speak with her to see what she knows."
"103224356-0-55097";"I should speak with Naheesh Nurwul about what Heem-Jas and I discovered. She may know how to destroy the lures."
"103224356-0-55099";"Naheesh Nurwul says we need to enter the xanmeer, Xal Irasotl, in order to destroy the lures. To do so safely, we need the help of the Imperials. I need to speak to Brigadine Lieutenant Viria to see if he will agree to this."
"103224356-0-55100";"Naheesh Nurwul gave me a ward to open the door to Xal Irasotl. I should head there while Naheesh Nurwul and Brigadine Lieutenant Viria gather their people."
"103224356-0-55101";"Now that we have access to the xanmeer, we need to explore and find the source of the lures while we wait for Naheesh Nurwul and the Imperials."
"103224356-0-55102";"Heem-Jas and I found Olik attempting to destroy one of the totems. I should speak to him."
"103224356-0-55103";"Naheesh Nurwul arrived with Argonian warriors, as well as Imperial soldiers. I should speak with her about our next steps."
"103224356-0-55104";"Heem-Jas and I need to disable the lures from here while the Imperial soldiers disable them from above."
"103224356-0-55109";"Heem-Jas and I disabled the lures underground inside the ruins. We need to get back to the others above ground to see if we were successful."
"103224356-0-55110";"I need to speak to Naheesh Nurwul to see if we were truly successful."
"103224356-0-55111";"I need to search the manor for any clues connected to Vandacia or the Order of the Waking Flame."
"103224356-0-55112";"I found a letter, part of an invitation, and an empty wardrobe. I should talk to Eveli and figure out what all this tells us."
"103224356-0-55113";"Since we don't know where the event is yet or how to get there, we need to follow up on the place where Vandacia may have recently visited. I need to go to the Salvitto Estate near Blackwood Lake."
"103224356-0-55114";"I arrived at the Salvitto Estate, but the place is crawling with Waking Flame cultists. I need to look around and see if we can figure out where Vandacia is or where his event is taking place."
"103224356-0-55116";"We caught up to Gracian Salvitto. Now we should speak to him."
"103224356-0-55117";"I should consult with Eveli and discuss what we learned from Gracian Salvitto."
"103224356-0-55118";"I need to travel to Leyawiin. Eveli will deal with Salvitto and meet me there."
"103224356-0-55119";"I arrived in Leyawiin. Now to talk to Eveli and see what we should do next."
"103224356-0-55120";"I should head to the Leyawiin docks and attempt to board the ship mentioned in the invitation, the Calamity."
"103224356-0-55121";"I need to find a berth to rest in while the Calamity completes its voyage to the location of Vandacia's special event. Before that, I could talk to the other passengers if I want."
"103224356-0-55122";"Now that we boarded the Calamity, I should talk to Eveli and see what she thinks of the accommodations."
"103224356-0-55124";"The ship has arrived at its location. I should find Eveli and talk to her."
"103224356-0-55127";"It appears that the ship somehow brought us to Mehrunes Dagon's Oblivion plane, the Deadlands. Apparently, Vandacia has a keep here. I need to get inside and see what's going on here."
"103224356-0-55128";"We made it into Vandacia's keep. I should talk to Eveli and discuss our next move."
"103224356-0-55129";"We need to search the keep and find out what Vandacia has brought his supporters here to see. If he has captured one of the remaining Ambitions, we need to set them free."
"103224356-0-55130";"We found a prisoner chained up in the depths of the keep. I should talk to him and find out who he is and why he's here."
"103224356-0-55133";"I need to get the key to unlock Sombren's chains. It should be somewhere in Kynreeve Dezerog's chamber in the northwestern portion of the keep."
"103224356-0-55135";"I acquired the key to set Sombren free from his chains. I should get back to him."
"103224356-0-55136";"The ceremony has already started! We need a diversion to rescue Sombren. I will need to place these reekers around the room and then signal Eveli."
"103224356-0-55137";"I placed the reekers and Eveli fired her arrows. Now clouds of noxious fumes have sent the nobles into a panic. This is the perfect opportunity to set Sombren free."
"103224356-0-55138";"Vandacia sent a Dremora to recapture Sombren. I need to defeat this creature while Lyranth opens a portal for us."
"103224356-0-55139";"Lyranth created a portal to transport us back to Nirn. I should enter the portal."
"103224356-0-55142";"Lyranth's portal dropped us right outside of Gideon. I should talk to Sombren and make sure he's all right."
"103224356-0-55143";"Governor Keshu has secured the twins in the Temple of Dibella in Gideon. I should take Sombren there so he can meet them."
"103224356-0-55145";"I interrurpted Baron Zaudrus's ritual, but he ran off with the lockbox Lyranth seeks. I need to kill him to retrieve it."
"103224356-0-55146";"While Eveli investigates Councilor Jirich's manor, I need to warn two other councilors, Councilor Sophus and Councilor Faleria, about the threat on their lives."
"103224356-0-55147";"While Eveli investigates Councilor Jirich's manor, I need to warn two other councilors, Councilor Sophus and Councilor Faleria, about the threat on their lives."
"103224356-0-55148";"I encountered Councilor Sophus's wife. I should ask her about her husband's whereabouts."
"103224356-0-55149";"Before I report to Captain Rian or take Sophus's sealed scroll to Councilor Lovidicus, I need to meet Eveli Sharp-Arrow at Councilor Jirich's manor in Leyawiin."
"103224356-0-55150";"Eveli and I need to go to Leyawiin Castle and speak to Councilor Lovidicus about what we know so far."
"103224356-0-55155";"Councilor Jirich's records include an order from Emperor Leovic. I should talk to Eveli about this discovery."
"103224356-0-55157";"Councilor Sophus went out for a walk with his dog Chaero. I should try to find them."
"103224356-0-55158";"Captain Rian Liore is waiting outside the legate chambers. I should fill him in on what Eveli and I learned."
"103224356-0-55159";"Councilor Faleria told me that Councilor Jirich kept secret documents in a hidden compartment in her nightstand. I should investigate there."
"103224356-0-55162";"I found Councilor Sophus's body and another Dark Brotherhood note. I should talk to his wife and see if I can learn anything else about what happened here."
"103224356-0-55166";"I uncovered several clues about the history of Zenithar's Abbey. I should discuss them with Daluion."
"103224356-0-55167";"Daluion suggested I check the directory at the bazaar to determine the shops of the three merchant lords mentioned in the documents we recovered."
"103224356-0-55168";"The directory noted the location of all three merchant lords' shops. I should investigate them for more information regarding the anvil's potential location to see where the trails lead."
"103224356-0-55170";"I acquired all of the sigil keys needed to open the magically sealed adytum. I just need to unlock it."
"103224356-0-55171";"Daluion believes we can begin restoring the Golden Anvil through a show of good, honest labor and trade before Zenithar. He asked me to place my hand on the anvil when I'm ready to begin."
"103224356-0-55172";"We discovered an anvil within the adytum, but it's seen better days. I should take a closer look with Daluion."
"103224356-0-55174";"Nuxul suggested that I start by speaking to the first Wind—Elossi, the Sudden Gust. I should find her in a hut to the south."
"103224356-0-55175";"We entered Elossi's home and at first it seemed empty. Then she appeared from nowhere and demanded to explain myself. I should speak to Elossi and ask for her help."
"103224356-0-55176";"I should search for Elossi's daggers. She said they aren't far, but I should be careful during my exploration, as there may be dangers lurking nearby."
"103224356-0-55178";"Elossi met me out by her cache. I should give her back the weapons I found."
"103224356-0-55179";"Elossi gave me a vague idea of where to find Meer-Ta, a companion of hers in the Four Winds. I should make my way to speak with him."
"103224356-0-55180";"I found Meer-Ta in his cavern home. I need to explain what is happening at the village and entreat his help."
"103224356-0-55181";"Meer-Ta was not receptive, and it doesn't look like he will join the fight. Still, he gave us directions to find Otumi-Ra, the last member of the Winds. I should go find him."
"103224356-0-55182";"I found Otumi-Ra at his hut. Snoring on the ground. He looks a bit worse for wear. I should try to rouse him if I can."
"103224356-0-55183";"Otumi-Ra isn't stirring. I should talk to Nuxul and see if he has some idea on what to do next."
"103224356-0-55184";"Nuxul mentioned a pungent seed that might help wake Otumi-Ra. I should seek them out and collect several to bring back."
"103224356-0-55185";"Hopefully I gathered enough of the waking seeds for now. I need to return them to Otumi-Ra's hut, where Nuxul is waiting for me."
"103224356-0-55186";"I should check in with Nuxul to make sure these are the right seeds and that we have enough of them."
"103224356-0-55187";"Nuxul said that I can just wave these under Otumi-Ra's nose, which should wake him up."
"103224356-0-55188";"Otumi-Ra is awake and on his feet. Now I need to explain what is happening back in the village."
"103224356-0-55189";"I followed Otumi-Ra. Now I should talk to him."
"103224356-0-55192";"Otumi-Ra challenged me to a drinking contest to test my strength. I need to figure out the right order to drink these in, or he won't accompany us into combat."
"103224356-0-55193";"I completed the challenge. I should check in with Otumi-Ra and ensure he will join the village's cause."
"103224356-0-55194";"Otumi-Ra asked me to issue a challenge to Meer-Ta by flying his sash on the cliffs above his hut. I should find a good spot so that Meer-Ta can see it."
"103224356-0-55195";"Now that the banner is placed, I should make my way back to the Stonewastes village and meet with Nuxul and the Winds."
"103224356-0-55196";"It appears a small army waits to assault the ruins. I should check in with Nuxul to discuss the plan."
"103224356-0-55197";"It is time to enter Stonewastes Keep, and bring down Warlord Naxhosa."
"103224356-0-55198";"I should talk to Elossi and see if she needs any help."
"103224356-0-55199";"Otumi-Ra seeks to knock a large pillar down on a set of siege weapons! He asked me to help him shove the pillar down."
"103224356-0-55200";"I found Meer-Ta. I should talk to him."
"103224356-0-55201";"I destroyed the Idol of Xulunaht and rescued Jela's friends. I should speak with Jela."
"103224356-0-55202";"Jela and I need to enter the xanmeer, Xi-Tsei, to rescue members of her tribe from the Sul-Xan's ritual and to destroy the Idol of Xulunaht."
"103224356-0-55204";"Jela's friends are safe. I should speak with her about what she wants to do next."
"103224356-0-55205";"I need to destroy the Sul-Xan's Idol of Xulunaht to keep them from ever using it again."
"103224356-0-55206";"I destroyed the Idol of Xulunaht. I should meet Jela outside."
"103224356-0-55207";"Meer-Ta has joined the fight. He found a group of enchanted weapons that must have been used to kill Satul-Sa. He asked me to find a Binding Word, so that he can undo the enchantment."
"103224356-0-55208";"I found the Binding Word. I should return it to Meer-Ta."
"103224356-0-55209";"With the siege weapons destroyed, the prisoners freed, his weapons disenchanted, and his army under assault, Naxhosa's grip on the keep is about to break. I should destroy his war banner at the top of the keep to signal his fall to his followers."
"103224356-0-55210";"I defeated Naxhosa. I should return to the village and meet with my allies."
"103224356-0-55211";"I found Councilor Lovidicus in Leyawiin Castle. I should speak with him."
"103224356-0-55212";"While Councilor Lovidicus sends for a scribe to decipher the Imperial code in the documents I gathered, he asked me to travel to Fort Blueblood and convince Councilor Abor to return to Leyawiin."
"103224356-0-55213";"I should present myself to the Fort Blueblood commander before I attempt to locate Councilor Abor."
"103224356-0-55214";"We entered the watchtower and found Councilor Abor dead. Murdered! I should look around and see if I can figure out what happened here."
"103224356-0-55215";"I should discuss the clues we found in the watchtower with Eveli Sharp-Arrow."
"103224356-0-55216";"A Borderwatch scout told me that I should talk to Commander Axius, commander of the garrison, to learn more about the situation."
"103224356-0-55217";"First, I need to infiltrate Borderwatch. Commander Axius recommended doing so via a sewer drain in the wilderness near the fortress."
"103224356-0-55218";"I infiltrated the sewers below Borderwatch. I should work my way up to the keep."
"103224356-0-55219";"I heard a voice cry out in the sewers below Borderwatch. I should investigate it."
"103224356-0-55220";"I found one of the infiltrators that was sent into Borderwatch to rescue the hostages before I arrived. I should speak with her."
"103224356-0-55221";"Erilthel asked me to help her find Seeks-the-Dark, who lured the Painted Eye away while she was told to escape. We should search the sewers for him."
"103224356-0-55222";"I found Seeks-the-Dark locked up. I should talk to Seeks-the-Dark about what happened while Erilthel works on freeing him."
"103224356-0-55223";"Seeks asked me to work to free the hostages while he acts as a distraction and Erilthel guides them through the sewer. Seeks suggested a group was taken to the southwest guard tower of the fortress."
"103224356-0-55224";"One of the hostages at the southeast guard tower, Calixto Tunifus, has something to tell me. I should see what he knows."
"103224356-0-55225";"I learned that the Painted Eye is holding a group of hostages in Borderwatch's smithy. I should find and save them."
"103224356-0-55226";"One of the hostages at the smithy, Shanil-Tee, wants to talk about the Painted Eye. I should see what she knows."
"103224356-0-55227";"I learned that the Painted Eye is holding a group of hostages in Borderwatch's stables. I should find and save them."
"103224356-0-55228";"One of the hostages at the stables, Otten, is practically clinging to me in fear. I should talk him down and see if he knows of anyone else still held captive."
"103224356-0-55229";"Otten is too terrified to escape without help and asked me to escort him to safety. I should lead his group to the sewer."
"103224356-0-55230";"Seeks-the-Dark approached our group as we made it to the sewer. I should see what he wants."
"103224356-0-55231";"After informing Seeks that the Painted Eye still have an Ayleid scholar as a prisoner, Seeks admitted that the Thieves Guild sent him for an Ayleid relic. He suspects that's why the Painted Eye is here as well. Seeks asked me to free the scholar."
"103224356-0-55232";"The Painted Eye is attempting to seize a powerful and dangerous Ayleid artifact hidden beneath Borderwatch's chapel. I need to get the key to unlock the crypt, which is in the commander's quarters."
"103224356-0-55233";"I have the key to the crypt. With it, Seeks and I may be able to beat the Painted Eye to the Ayleid relic hidden beneath Borderwatch."
"103224356-0-55234";"The Painted Eye has already made it to the Ayleid ruin beneath Borderwatch. I need to catch up with them."
"103224356-0-55235";"Seeks-the-Dark and I have found the Painted Eye's leader attempting to claim the dangerous relic in the Ayleid ruin. We have to find a way to stop her."
"103224356-0-55236";"We stopped the Painted Eye from claiming the relic, but the catastrophic end of the ritual triggered a cave-in. I need to escape the ruin before it collapses."
"103224356-0-55237";"I should inform Commander Axius that the situation at Borderwatch has been dealt with."
"103224356-0-55239";"Search For Clues"
"103224356-0-55241";"Seeks-the-Dark, Erilthel, and I have made it out of the Ayleid ruin beneath Borderwatch. I should talk to them about what happens next."
"103224356-0-55242";"Bastian said that the Dark Elf who knocked him out dropped something by the nearby shack. Maybe there's a clue here. I should look around for it."
"103224356-0-55243";"I rescued Quistley Silvelle from Deepscorn Hollow, but what to do with him? Bastian says he has an idea that should satisfy Larz-Tul. He's going to strike a deal with Tenarei."
"103224356-0-55244";"Lyranth departed, certain that this mystery concerning Leovic's secret and the Ambitions of Mehrunes Dagon has just begun. I should talk to Eveli and see what she thinks about all this."
"103224356-0-55245";"I found a contract between Tenarei Vels and a criminal in Leyawiin. It appears that Bastian's assailant is also looking for Quistley Silvelle in Deepscorn Hollow. I should talk to Bastian about the contract I found."
"103224356-0-55246";"At first glance, this appears to be a deserted cavern. There's no sign of Tenarei Vels or Quistley Silvelle, so there must be more to this place. I should look around more."
"103224356-0-55247";"I agreed to help Bastian retrieve Quistley Silvelle, but it appears that the Dark Elf Tenarei Vels is also looking for him. This should be interesting. Time to go down into Deepscorn Hollow."
"103224356-0-55250";"The invitation says we need formal attire to attend this mysterious event. Eveli suggested we visit Percius Loche, the tailor here in Leyawiin."
"103224356-0-55253";"Now that we selected our formal attire, I should talk to Eveli and see if she's ready to go."
"103224356-0-55256";"Bastian and I entered Deepscorn Hollow. This does not appear to be a common smuggler's cave. I should continue exploring."
"103224356-0-55257";"Bastian and I found some people locked in a cage in the second cavern. We should help them."
"103224356-0-55258";"The prisoners we freed told us that these caves are occupied by a cult dedicated to Sithis, not smugglers. They believe the cultists are planning to sacrifice people to their god. I should confer with Bastian."
"103224356-0-55262";"The tailor Percius Loche can supply us with formal attire. I can either pay for the outfits with gold, or trade for them by gathering bluewhisper moth silk from their nests along the river north of Leyawiin."
"103224356-0-55271";"Amalia told me I'll find Phalevon's relics within Undertow Cavern. I need to venture into the cave."
"103224356-0-55273";"We retrieved the last of Phalevon's relics. We should leave Undertow Cavern before the horn causes any more trouble."
"103224356-0-55274";"As promised, I helped <<1>> recover Phalevon's relics. I should leave them in her care and claim my reward."
"103224356-0-55278";"Place Smoke Bombs"
"103224356-0-55284";"Lyranth says she can open a portal back to Nirn for us, but she can only do it in the entry hall. I need to follow Eveli and Sombren and get to that location."
"103224356-0-55285";"Governor Keshu asked me to speak with the Ambitions and see if we can figure out a better place to hide them than in Gideon. I'll find them in the Temple of Dibella."
"103224356-0-55286";"I arrived at the temple to see Calia's powers rage out of control. Luckily, Sombren was able to contain them before too much damage occurred. I should talk to Sombren."
"103224356-0-55287";"Now that I informed Eveli as to our plans, I need to meet the Ambitions at a shrine in the marsh to the north and west of Gideon."
"103224356-0-55288";"Sombren revealed that his mentor is a Dremora. He wants me to speak to Xynaa and find out if she thinks she can help the twins as she helped Sombren."
"103224356-0-55289";"Xynaa said she can prevent Calia and Destron from destroying themselves. I should speak with Sombren. He can tell me more about the process and finding Xynaa's sanctuary."
"103224356-0-55290";"Before we can take the twins into the Deadlands to meet with Xynaa, they have to be attuned to the plane. We need to gather fragments of the Deadlands that have made their way to Tamriel."
"103224356-0-55291";"Calia, Destron, and I gathered two slivers of fragments from the Deadlands. Now we need to meet Sombren on the road south of Gideon."
"103224356-0-55292";"We met Sombren on the road south of Gideon. Now to talk to him and see what we need to do next."
"103224356-0-55293";"Sombren and the twins opened a portal to the Deadlands. I should follow them to the other side."
"103224356-0-55294";"We arrived in the Deadlands and were greeted by another projection of Xynaa. I should talk to her."
"103224356-0-55295";"Xynaa instructed Calia and Destron to find obelisks that will reveal hidden truths. Since the Ambitions can't use their power without risking disaster, I must protect them as they walk this path."
"103224356-0-55296";"We reached the first of the obelisks. I need to activate the obelisk in my role as witness to the truths that Calia and Destron are about to learn."
"103224356-0-55297";"The first obelisk showed us a vision of the twins' past. Now to get them safely to the next obelisk."
"103224356-0-55298";"We reached the second obelisk. I need to activate it in my role as witness to the truths that Calia and Destron are about to learn."
"103224356-0-55300";"The second obelisk showed us a vision of the twins' past. Now to get them safely to the final obelisk."
"103224356-0-55303";"To get to Farrul Lupus, we need to meet with Renna at the Mages Guildhall in Riften. I can take the cart or make my own way there and rendezvous with Eveli at the Mages Guild."
"103224356-0-55304";"We found the last obelisk and a portal opened when we arrived. It seems Calia, Destron, and I must enter that portal to see the final vision."
"103224356-0-55305";"The last obelisk's portal took me to the Imperial Throne Room in the White-Gold Tower. Vandacia sits on the throne, and Mehrunes Dagon watches outside. How is this possible? I should speak with Vandacia."
"103224356-0-55306";"I spoke with Emperor Vandacia in a vision of a terrible future. He claimed that he destroyed me many years ago. However, Sombren arrived and offered a way out. I should take it."
"103224356-0-55307";"Now that we completed the three visions of the obelisks, I should talk to the Ambitions and make sure everyone is ready for what comes next."
"103224356-0-55308";"We need to enter Xynaa's sanctuary so that she can show the twins how to control their powers."
"103224356-0-55309";"We entered Xynaa's sanctuary. Now I should talk to the Dremora."
"103224356-0-55310";"Xynaa is ready to teach the twins to control their power. We should follow her."
"103224356-0-55311";"Xynaa betrayed us! She used some sort of magic to teleport me and Sombren into a dungeon. Sombren appears to be wounded. I should check on him."
"103224356-0-55312";"Xynaa drained Sombren's power. He suggested I retrieve the skull of a Daedric lord from Xynaa's treasure chamber. He believes he can use the energy within it to recharge his power."
"103224356-0-55313";"I recovered the skull of Xynaa's enemy. Now I should head to the door in the north and meet up with Sombren."
"103224356-0-55314";"I found Sombren in a meditative state, just like he told me. I should present the skull to him so it can recharge his power."
"103224356-0-55315";"Now that Sombren's power has been recharged, we need to return to Xynaa's sanctuary and find Calia and Destron."
"103224356-0-55316";"Xynaa appears to be about to sacrifice the twins. While Sombren protects them, I need to deal with Xynaa."
"103224356-0-55317";"Calia and Destron opened a portal to Gideon. I should follow them."
"103224356-0-55318";"Sombren made a mistake and led us to a Dremora loyal to Mehrunes Dagon. We escaped, but not before she tried to sacrifice the twins and kill us. I should talk to Sombren."
"103224356-0-55325";"Eveli asked me to talk to Renna while she keeps watch. She has a feeling that someone has been following her and doesn't want us being caught by surprise. I should go talk to Renna."
"103224356-0-55326";"A frightened prisoner is anxious to get out of these caves, but he seems willing to speak to me. I should see if he knows anything."
"103224356-0-55327";"Deepscorn Hollow appears to be a maze of caves and passages. We should continue our search."
"103224356-0-55328";"We came upon culists of Sithis performing a ritual in one of the caves. We should interrupt the ritual and attempt to corner a cultist for information."
"103224356-0-55329";"We interrupted cultists performing some ritual in the lower cavern. One cultist was hiding and tried to sneak away. Bastian thinks we should grab him and interrogate him."
"103224356-0-55330";"I cornered a cultist who was participating in a ritual in the cavern nearby. He might know something about where Quistley Silvelle is being held."
"103224356-0-55332";"To participate, I need to travel through Elsweyr and accomplish a set of tasks."
"103224356-0-55335";"Renna explained that Farrul Lupus and her live in a house here in Riften, around the corner from the bank. Eveli and I should go there and talk to the late emperor's steward."
"103224356-0-55336";"Farrul Lupus called out from inside the house. He sounds hurt and in need of help. We must find a way inside and quickly."
"103224356-0-55347";"I interrogated a captured cultist. He told me that the Daughter of Sithis, leader of this cult, has Quistley. He also says that Tenarei Vels may have been caught by the Sithis cult. I should see what Bastian suggests."
"103224356-0-55348";"Bastian and I agreed to split up. He wants to question the cultist more closely about the Daughter of Sithis, but it sounds like Tenarei Vels is in immediate danger of being sacrificed. I need to find her."
"103224356-0-55349";"I found Tenarei Vels suspended in the middle of some ritual. I should free her before the Cult of Sithis completes their sacrificial rite."
"103224356-0-55352";"I freed Tenarei Vels from the cultists' ritual. She suggested that we find a safe place to talk. I should follow her."
"103224356-0-55353";"Tenarei offered to help me find Quistley Silvelle. I should continue to explore the lower caverns of Deepscorn Hollow."
"103224356-0-55354";"The cultists have a vampire imprisoned. He may be able to help us."
"103224356-0-55358";"The hidden passage led us to a door. If Tenarei is right, this should lead to the inner sanctum of this cult. I should continue on."
"103224356-0-55360";"I explored the lower levels of Deepscorn Hollow. Tenarei Vels believes we are drawing close to the lair of the Daughter of Sithis, but she wants to speak with me before we go on. I should see what's on her mind."
"103224356-0-55362";"We found Quistley Silvelle and the Daughter of Sithis. It's time to save Quistley, whether he wants to be saved or not."
"103224356-0-55365";"The Daughter of Sithis had Quistley Silvelle, but she wasn't holding him prisoner. He was very upset when he saw Bastian and fled into another room. I need to talk to him and see if I can sort this out."
"103224356-0-55366";"Quistley Silvelle had no idea what sort of danger he was in. I must decide whether I allow Tenarei Vels to take him back to the gangster Larz-Tul, or let Bastian get him away from Blackwood."
"103224356-0-55368";"Both Bastian and Tenarei have a claim on Quistley Silvelle, but it sounds as though Bastian has an idea on how to solve this dilemma. I should talk to him."
"103224356-0-55371";"I should speak with Eveli and see if she has any ideas on how we go about finding the remaining Ambitions."
"103224356-0-55372";"Farrul Lupus has been murdered and I found a sheet of paper decorated with a bloody hand print on his body. Renna and Eveli have arrived. I should talk to Renna and see if she has any idea what happened here."
"103224356-0-55374";"I should talk to Revus Demnevanni at his camp outside the Ayleid ruins of Veyond."
"103224356-0-55375";"Revus Demnevanni urged me to meet him at his field laboratory inside the ruins of Veyond."
"103224356-0-55376";"Revus Demnevanni wants me to paint a series of stabilizing runes around his experiment site. I should also speak with his student, Tiras Tirethi."
"103224356-0-55379";"I finished painting the stabilizing runes. I should talk to Revus about what comes next."
"103224356-0-55380";"Revus needs me to help him prepare for his experiment by re-attuning any instruments that stop working during the kindling process. I should listen to him for instructions as I work."
"103224356-0-55381";"Revus Demnevanni is performing his experiment. I should wait for him to complete it."
"103224356-0-55382";"It appears that Revus Demnevanni's experiment failed. I should speak to him about what to do next."
"103224356-0-55383";"Revus Demnavanni thinks there's something magical in Veyond's lower chambers that's disrupting his experiment. He urged me to take Tiras deeper into the ruin to root out the source of the interference."
"103224356-0-55384";"Tiras and I found a number of clouded varla stones in Veyond's lower vaults. I should wait for the young Dark Elf to analyze the situation."
"103224356-0-55385";"Tiras drained the energies from the clouded varla stones and encouraged me to smash them. Hopefully, breaking them will resolve Revus's issue."
"103224356-0-55388";"Revus Demnevanni arrived. He seems intent on speaking with Tiras about our next move. I should listen in."
"103224356-0-55389";"Tiras Tirethi vanished in a freak accident. I should speak to Revus Demnevanni about our next course of action."
"103224356-0-55390";"Tiras Tirethi may still be still alive, but cursed in some way. I should follow Revus and try to find him in deeper inside Veyond."
"103224356-0-55391";"Revus's attempt to free Tiras failed. Now, some force has dragged the student deeper into the ruin. I should talk to Revus Demnevanni about what is happening to his pupil."
"103224356-0-55392";"Something is drawing Tiras Tirethi through Veyond. I need to follow him and help Revus Demnevanni undo the curse on his student before it's too late."
"103224356-0-55393";"Revus thinks the greatest source of disruptive energy is somewhere nearby. We should look for this central lode. If we find it, we might have a chance of rescuing Tiras Terethi from his fate."
"103224356-0-55394";"We found a clouded Ayleid Well which may tear Tiras to pieces if we don't destroy it. I should speak to Revus Demnavanni about what to do next."
"103224356-0-55395";"Tiras survived the destruction of the well, and seemed genuinely grateful. Revus urged me to meet him back on the surface near his camp. I should make my way there."
"103224356-0-55396";"I should speak to Revus Demnevanni at his camp outside Veyond."
"103224356-0-55399";"I should talk to Revus Demnevanni and learn how I can help with his experiment."
"103224356-0-55400";"Enter the Festival Arena by obtaining a King Boar Invitational ticket."
"103224356-0-55401";"Collect fermented mudcrab apples by gathering them during the King Boar challenge in the <<1>>. Gaining access to the Arena requires an Invitation."
"103224356-0-55402";"I gathered some fermented mudcrab apples, I can gather more or return to <<1>> to see if she can use them."
"103224356-0-55403";"I have fermented mudcrab apples for <<1>>. I should speak to her about getting my cider."
"103224356-0-55407";"Return to the <<1>> to find fermented mudcrab apples. You may need to acquire another King Boar Invitational ticket."
"103224356-0-55408";"I found another hidden annex entrance but the ward was already removed. The cultists must be inside. I should enter and secure the cache before they can acquire it."
"103224356-0-55409";"Eveli wants to go to Gideon and talk to Keshu the Black Fin, governor of the city. I should meet her there."
"103224356-0-55410";"I arrived in Gideon. Now I should meet Eveli at the governor's mansion so we can talk to Keshu."
"103224356-0-55412";"According to Governor Keshu, ojel-bak refers to a natural formation in Sul-Xan territory. It translates roughly to ""the pit of the outsider."" I need to meet Eveli on the edge of the area to begin our search."
"103224356-0-55413";"I arrived at the border of the Sul-Xan territory. I should talk to Eveli before we venture any farther."
"103224356-0-55414";"We believe that the vault containing the Four Ambitions is located in the area referred to as the ojel-bak, or the pit of the outsider. We need to find this place before Vandacia and his cultists do."
"103224356-0-55415";"The Dremora Lyranth appeared as we approached the location. She wants to talk to us. I should speak to her."
"103224356-0-55416";"Lyranth explained that the vault is warded, so I need to find a way to remove the wards before we can enter and search for the Four Ambitions."
"103224356-0-55417";"We removed the first ward and opened the door to the vault. Now to go inside and see what else awaits us."
"103224356-0-55418";"We entered the vault, but Lyranth went on ahead. Before we proceed, I should talk to Eveli."
"103224356-0-55419";"Now that we're inside, we should explore the vault and try to find the Four Ambitions before Vandacia and the Waking Flame cultists arrive."
"103224356-0-55420";"Eveli spotted another warded door ahead of us. I should talk to her before I attempt to disrupt the ward."
"103224356-0-55421";"The ward cubes and lectern are arranged similarly to the ones outside the vault. With the book in place, I need to turn the ward cubes to match the symbols, disrupt the ward, and open the door."
"103224356-0-55422";"I disrupted the ward and opened the inner door. Now to keep exploring the vault. We need to find the Four Ambitions."
"103224356-0-55423";"We need to find a way to lower the bridge so we can cross the chasm and continue our search. I should look around the area for a switch or a lever."
"103224356-0-55424";"One more ward stands between us and the inner vault. Eveli has placed the book on the lectern. Now I need to rotate the cubes to disrupt the ward."
"103224356-0-55426";"I disrupted the ward and unlocked the door. Now to see what waits inside the vault's inner chamber."
"103224356-0-55427";"Instead of a cache of Daedric weapons, we found two people inside the inner vault. I should talk to them and discover who they are."
"103224356-0-55428";"Eveli called out. Sounds like she's in trouble. I better go find her while Lyranth gets the twins to safety."
"103224356-0-55429";"I reached Eveli. I should find out what she knows about the Waking Flame cultists that used portals to enter the vault."
"103224356-0-55430";"We need to track down the Waking Flame cultists who entered the vault via portals after we took down all the wards."
"103224356-0-55431";"We found Lyranth and the twins just as a group of cultists were about to grab them. Instead, Destron unleashed immense power and eliminated the threat. I should ask him how he accomplished that."
"103224356-0-55432";"Now that the cultists here have been dealt with and the twins were confirmed to be two of the Ambitions, I should talk to Eveli and see if we can figure out what to do with the twins."
"103224356-0-55433";"Eveli decided to bring the twins to Gideon so that Governor Keshu can help protect them. I should meet them there."
"103224356-0-55434";"I returned to Gideon. Eveli said to meet at the governor's mansion so we could bring Keshu up to speed on the Ambitions. I should head there and talk to her."
"103224356-0-55435";"I have fermented mudcrab apples for <<1>>. I should speak to her about getting my cider."
"103224356-0-55436";"I have fermented mudcrab apples for <<1>>. I should speak to her about getting my cider."
"103224356-0-55437";"I delivered the fermented mudcrab apples to <<1>>. I should speak to her about getting my cider."
"103224356-0-55444";"Stone walls surround the Silent Halls, but there is an entryway we can use to get inside."
"103224356-0-55445";"Adrahawn appears to have brought Bevene back from the brink of death. I should speak to him now that the ordeal is over."
"103224356-0-55446";"I arrived at Renna's house. I should knock twice on the door or Farrul Lupus won't respond."
"103224356-0-55447";"The vampire held prisoner in this dead end told me there's a switch concealed beneath a crate nearby that opens a hidden passage. I should look around for it."
"103224356-0-55449";"We were too late to save Farrul Lupus and now the trail seems to have grown cold. I should meet Eveli under the docks and see if she has any idea what we should do next."
"103224356-0-55450";"We discovered the inner sanctum of the cult. Quistley should be somewhere inside … and possibly the woman who calls herself the Daughter of Sithis."
"103224356-0-55455";"While Eveli and I have run into a dead end, Lyranth arrived and claims to have important information to share. I should talk to her."
"103224356-0-55457";"Adrahawn reacted to something the moment we entered the ruins. He claims the plants are shouting, but I can't hear anything. He suggested we search the overgrowth for some clue as to what the issue is."
"103224356-0-55460";"Upon entering the Silent Halls, we discovered some signs of recent occupancy. I should search the items left here for some clue about who's been here."
"103224356-0-55461";"Adrahawn and I decided to resume our search for the source of the harrada creeper growth, wary that we might not be alone down here."
"103224356-0-55464";"We found a wounded Dark Elf among the bodies of some people who were recently killed. I should speak to her about what happened to them."
"103224356-0-55465";"The Dark Elf begged me to rescue her family still being held captive by a tribe of hostile Argonians called the Sul-Xan. I should speak to Adrahawn about this."
"103224356-0-55466";"Adrahawn believes that helping the people held captive by the Sul-Xan should be our first priority. We need to locate where they are being held prisoner."
"103224356-0-55467";"The Sul-Xan's prisoners are being forced to tend to the harrada creepers vines throughout a large cavern. I need to undo their chains and release them."
"103224356-0-55468";"Adrahawn will catch up once he's finished dealing with the seeds and Bevene. I should head outside to join the escapees."
"103224356-0-55471";"Commander Ortin asked Eveli and I to investigate the missing servant and her connection to the councilor's murder. He suggested we ask the other servants working in the kitchen and dining hall."
"103224356-0-55474";"Lyranth has opened a portal to the Imperial sewers. Apparently, the scroll recovered in the first cache annex we explored provided her with the location of another cache below the Imperial City. I should step through the portal and investigate."
"103224356-0-55475";"Eveli and I are inside the annex hidden in the Imperial Sewers, but the Waking Flame cult is already here. I need to find more clues relating to Leovic's secret and try to determine what the cult is doing down here."
"103224356-0-55478";"According to Leovic's journal, his father built a shrine to Mehrunes Dagon in this hidden complex. And the ritual I recovered indicates that the cult plans to use this shrine to learn the location of the Ambitions. I should find the shrine."
"103224356-0-55479";"Doombringer Eshil stepped through a portal behind the large statue. We need to follow him before the portal closes."
"103224356-0-55481";"Doombringer Eshil stepped through a portal behind the large statue. We need to follow him before the portal closes."
"103224356-0-55482";"We followed Doombringer Eshil into the Deadlands, the Oblivion realm of Mehrunes Dagon! We need to find the cult leader and stop him."
"103224356-0-55483";"We found Doombringer Eshil. We should kill him and put a stop to whatever evil he's doing."
"103224356-0-55484";"We defeated Doombringer Eshil. A voice claiming to be Mehrunes Dagon opened a portal and told us to leave this realm. I guess we should oblige."
"103224356-0-55485";"The portal returned us to Elden Root. Lyranth is here. I should tell her what we uncovered."
"103224356-0-55486";"Yisara asked me to meet her in the city gardens. According to the locals, a ghostly presence wanders the area. This might be a perfect opportunity to test her magic lantern."
"103224356-0-55487";"Yisara seems eager to accept Mathen's proposal. I should speak with her."
"103224356-0-55491";"I found Yisara in the city gardens. I should talk to her before we try to contact the spirit with her magic lantern."
"103224356-0-55504";"Yisara's lantern seems to be reacting to something. I should give it a shake to see if it works."
"103224356-0-55505";"Yisara's lantern worked! A ghost appeared and is speaking. I should talk to her."
"103224356-0-55509";"The ghost of Duchess Astella insisted that someone named Alizinda placed a curse on Castle Giovesse. I should speak with Yisara about what we discovered and what comes next."
"103224356-0-55510";"Yisara wants to investigate the cottage Duchess Astella told us about. It should be northeast of Gideon. If we can summon the ghost of the duchess's son, we might learn more about the curse of Castle Giovesse."
"103224356-0-55511";"We found the cottage where Mathen and his lover, Alizinda, used to meet. I should have a look around."
"103224356-0-55517";"Eveli wants to review what we learned by questioning the servants. I should talk to her."
"103224356-0-55518";"Talaise the servant was murdered. I should talk to Eveli about this development."
"103224356-0-55519";"I purchased outfits for myself and Eveli. I should select the formal attire I want to wear to the event while Eveli does the same."
"103224356-0-55520";"It seems that the missing servant may have visited the pantry before taking Councilor Abor's meal to the watchtower. We should take a look and see if we can find any indication of what happened to her there."
"103224356-0-55522";"Now that we are out of Bloodrun Cave, I should speak to Mim-Jasa about what just occurred."
"103224356-0-55523";"I should enter Bloodrun Cave so I can help Mim-Jasa destroy the remains of the dead Shadowscales."
"103224356-0-55524";"Mim-Jasa and I need to find the remains of the Shadowscales and destroy them in order to protect their spirits from Tumma-Maxath."
"103224356-0-55527";"I destroyed the skull of the Shadowscale Ajum-Shei. I should leave Bloodrun Cave and meet Mim-Jasa outside."
"103224356-0-55530";"We destroyed the remains of the Shadowscales, but found one skeleton without a head. Mim-Jasa seems worried about this. I should speak with him about it."
"103224356-0-55531";"Mim-Jasa fears the necromancer Tumma-Maxath took the missing skull of the Shadowscale Ajum-Shei in order to power his ritual. We need to locate the skull and destroy it."
"103224356-0-55534";"I found a tarnished ring and the frayed remains of an old journal. I should show these items to Yisara."
"103224356-0-55535";"I should light the spirit lantern to summon Mathen's ghost. Hopefully he can shed some light on the origin of the curse."
"103224356-0-55539";"The lantern illuminated another restless spirit: Duchess Astella's son, Mathen. I should speak with him."
"103224356-0-55540";"Mathen is not sure if his missing regalia is tied to his spirit being bound to this plane, but suggested we investigate the chapel in the ruins of the once-proud Castle Giovesse."
"103224356-0-55541";"We found the chapel in Castle Giovesse where Duchess Astella laid Mathen to rest. I should search for Mathen's golden armor. With any luck, it will provide the means to break the castle's curse."
"103224356-0-55544";"I discovered a curious incantation scrawled on a dusty scroll. This may be related to the Giovesse curse. I should share it with Yisara."
"103224356-0-55545";"Yisara seems confident that Alizinda did not write this incantation, which means someone else is responsible for the curse. I should ignite the spirit lantern again. With any luck, a nearby ghost can shed some more light on this mystery."
"103224356-0-55549";"Duchess Astella appeared when I ignited the lantern. I should find out what she's doing in the chapel."
"103224356-0-55550";"Duchess Astella, not Alizinda, inadvertently placed the curse on Castle Giovesse during a botched necromantic ritual. Finding the duchess' notes may be our only means of reversing the spell and liberating the souls trapped here."
"103224356-0-55551";"In order to break the curse on Castle Giovesse, we need to find Mathen's golden armor. According to Duchess Astella's notes, we'll find his helm, breastplate, and shield hidden under clumps of heartsbane all around the castle grounds."
"103224356-0-55553";"Yisara feels uneasy about collecting Mathen's armor and wants to try contacting him again to get his opinion. I should ignite the spirit lantern to see if he'll appear."
"103224356-0-55557";"We found piece of Mathen's armor, but Yisara wants to speak before we continue our search."
"103224356-0-55562";"Alchemy tells me that the people in town have been reluctant to speak to her and her troupe. She asked me to speak with several people in town who had their loved ones vanish to try and get the whole story."
"103224356-0-55563";"Maelle Favraud said her daughter ran away recently and she worries that Annyce may fall victim to the same circumstances that befell the other townfolk. I agreed to search for Annyce and she told me I might want to start my search at their home."
"103224356-0-55564";"Maelle suspects that Annyce might have run off to her childhood play fort. I should look for her there."
"103224356-0-55568";"We found Annyce's old play fort, but it's still in very good condition and shows signs of recent use. I should look around."
"103224356-0-55570";"Alchemy feels confident that she's got a read on Annyce's motivations and she noticed some clues that Annyce may have had help running away. There are some tracks leading out into the marsh. We should take our search that way."
"103224356-0-55571";"Annyce's trail lead to a small ruin in the marsh, filled with books. There's no sign of Annyce, but I should search the small ruin for clues."
"103224356-0-55573";"There are signs that someone has been to this ruin recently and burned some things. I should see what Alchemy makes of what we found."
"103224356-0-55574";"Alchemy believes that some sort of ritual was conducted at the ruin, but Annyce's trail ends here. Alchemy wants to remain at the ruin a while longer to study things in more detail. She suggests I go back to town and keep an eye out for Annyce."
"103224356-0-55575";"It appears that Annyce has returned to Farmer's Nook. She's at the Happy Crow Inn. I should speak to her."
"103224356-0-55576";"I spoke to Annyce, but she didn't seem to want to share any details about what happened to her. Alchemy pulled me aside to talk in private, I should hear what she has to say."
"103224356-0-55577";"Alchemy informed me that the ruin where we found the ritual was one of many Ayleid ruins in the area devoted to Hermaeus Mora, the Daedric Prince of Forbidden Knowledge. Alchemy wants to investigate another, larger ruin north of town."
"103224356-0-55578";"Alchemy and I found the Ayleid ruin she mentioned. She'd like me to lead the way in case there's danger. I should try the door."
"103224356-0-55579";"When I tried to open the tomb, a magical ward repelled me and a guardian appeared. Alchemy seemed to recognize them as a character from the book we found. I should speak to the guardian to see about gaining entry to the ruin."
"103224356-0-55585";"I dealt with all of the guardians preventing me from entering the Ayleid ruin. Time to explore it."
"103224356-0-55587";"We found all the people who had vanished from Farmer's Nook in the ruin, alive and well, but locked in a deep sleep. I should speak to Alchemy about this."
"103224356-0-55588";"Alchemy seems more confident that she can safely break the spell on the dreamers. I should wait for her to finish her attempt."
"103224356-0-55589";"Annyce and the others are awake, but they aren't happy about it. I should speak to Annyce and find out how she wound up like this."
"103224356-0-55590";"Annyce's mother arrived while I was questioning Annyce. I should speak to Maelle about the imposter, Cres."
"103224356-0-55592";"With Annynce and the others awakened from their supernatural dream, I should head back to Farmer's Nook and confront Cres about their involvement in this."
"103224356-0-55593";"I arrived to find Bradon searching for Annyce. I should find out what happened from him."
"103224356-0-55594";"Bradon said that ""Annyce"" suddenly rushed out of the inn and ran out of town, but he couldn't keep up with her. I should head after her and see if I can catch Cres."
"103224356-0-55595";"I found ""Annyce"" hiding in the small Ayleid ruin we found before. Time to confront Cres."
"103224356-0-55596";"Cres tried to maintain their ruse, but became desperate as it became clear their plan was foiled. Cres wanted to bargain with me, but Alchemy has had enough of the deception. She's trying to unmask the imposter."
"103224356-0-55597";"Cres confessed that they do not enjoy their existence in the service of Hermaeus Mora and was bargaining with the disillusioned townsfolk to take over their lives in Farmer's Nook. I should speak to Alchemy about what we should do with the Daedra."
"103224356-0-55598";"Alchemy sympathizes with Cres's plight and suggested that she might be able to give them the life they desire as a part of the House of Reveries. I need to decide whether that's a good idea or if it would be safer to send Cres back to Oblivion."
"103224356-0-55599";"I decided that it would be best to send Cres back to Oblivion. Alchemy will banish them."
"103224356-0-55600";"I agreed that Alchemy should offer Cres a place in the House of Reveries. She will make a pact with the Daedra and give them a life as a member of her troupe."
"103224356-0-55603";"While Eveli returns to Leyawiin to consult with Councilor Lovidicus, I need to go to Tidewater Cave to talk to Councilor Faleria, and to Gideon to warn Councilor Vandacia."
"103224356-0-55604";"I arrived in Gideon and it seems that Councilor Vandacia survived an attack. I should speak to him and find out what happened."
"103224356-0-55605";"I need to make sure that Councilor Faleria finished her business at Tidewater Cave and will return to Leyawiin for her safety."
"103224356-0-55606";"I warned everyone I could. Now to return to Leyawiin Castle and report to Councilor Lovidicus."
"103224356-0-55607";"Mathen appeared. I should speak to him about Yisara's concerns."
"103224356-0-55610";"Driven by romantic passion, Mathen whisked Yisara away and vanished. I need to find the rest of his armor quickly. Hopefully performing the duchess's ritual will bring him and Yisara back."
"103224356-0-55611";"I found Mathen's breastplate and shield. I should ignite the spirit lantern to summon Duchess Astella. Hopefully she can help me break the curse and rescue Yisara."
"103224356-0-55612";"Duchess Astella appeared. I should talk to her about how to break the curse and how to free Yisara."
"103224356-0-55613";"Duchess Astella requires one last item to break the curse: the Sword of Giovesse. I need to delve into the castle's mausoleum to reclaim the blade."
"103224356-0-55614";"I found the Sword of Giovesse. I should take it and Mathen's armor to Tavia's Tower. Hopefully we can break the curse and return Yisara to the land of the living."
"103224356-0-55615";"I should use the spirit lantern one last time to summon the spirits of Castle Giovesse."
"103224356-0-55616";"The Duchess, Mathen, and Yisara all appeared when I used the spirit lantern. Duchess Astella urged me to lay out Mathen's armor and the Sword of Giovesse. Hopefully this will free both the spirits of Giovesse and Yisara."
"103224356-0-55622";"Duchess Astella vanished when I returned Mathen's regalia to the altar in Tavia's Tower, but Mathen himself remains. I should talk to him about what happened."
"103224356-0-55623";"Mathen believes his soul is bound to the ring of Mara he intended to give to Alizinda all those years ago. He wants to speak with Yisara about what he should do."
"103224356-0-55624";"Mathen declared his love for Yisara and told her that the ring she carries has the power to bind him to her. If she destroys the ring, his spirit will fade to Aetherius and his soul will be at peace. The choice is hers. I should talk to her."
"103224356-0-55625";"Yisara was moved by Mathen's proposal, but her conscience moved her to destroy the ring that bound Mathen to the mortal plane. I should talk to her about what comes next."
"103224356-0-55627";"I need to ensure that Councilor Faleria finished her business at Tidewater Cave and will return to Leyawiin."
"103224356-0-55628";"I need to go to Gideon and warn Councilor Vandacia about the assassination attempts. Eveli suggested I could find him in the Gideon courthouse."
"103224356-0-55635";"Councilor Vandacia says his personal guard thwarted his assassin and he's been imprisoned in a cell in the courthouse basement. I should go down and interrogate the prisoner."
"103224356-0-55636";"The assassin somehow disabled the cell lock and escaped. I should examine the lock and determine what happened."
"103224356-0-55637";"Whatever acid the assassin used to destroy the lock appears to have dripped as he escaped and left a trail. I should follow it."
"103224356-0-55638";"The assassin's trail led to a hidden chamber. I should look around."
"103224356-0-55639";"The assassin wishes to speak with me."
"103224356-0-55640";"The assassin, Elam Drals, claims the Dark Brotherhood didn't kill the councilors and that he never attacked Councilor Vandacia. I should return to the courthouse and show Vandacia the letter I found."
"103224356-0-55641";"I helped Hokatsei restore her brother Deet-Loh and lift the Nereid's curse. Now I should talk to her about the reward she promised me."
"103224356-0-55642";"We bathed Deet-Loh in three different pools, but nothing seemed to appease the Nereid. I should talk to Hokatsei and see if she has any other bright ideas."
"103224356-0-55643";"I arrived at Leyawiin Castle. Now I should report to Councilor Lovidicus and let him know what I uncovered."
"103224356-0-55645";"<<1>> has more information about this competition I've been invited to participate in."
"103224356-0-55646";"<<1>> informed me that I'm officially entered to participate in bouts with King Boar. Now I need to defeat him to claim my prize."
"103224356-0-55647";"A ward bars the door into a hidden annex and apparently it is extremely dangerous to Daedra. She gave me an amulet that should allow me to destroy the ward. I should use it and see what happens."
"103224356-0-55650";"Perhaps Alchemy will have some idea what is going on."
"103224356-0-55653";"I agreed to escort Hokatsei through the ruins of Vunalk to bathe her brother Deet-Loh in the Nereid's waters. I should enter the ruins."
"103224356-0-55654";"Hokatsei suggests we need to bathe her brother in at least three different pools within the ruins to appease Sister of Pools. I should find some suitable locations."
"103224356-0-55659";"Hokatsei thinks that if Deet-Loh sings with the Nereid's frog, that will show the water spirit that they're happy and make her forgive her brother. I just need to escort Deet-Loh deeper into the ruins."
"103224356-0-55660";"Now that Deet-Loh has been restored to his natural form, I should meet him and his sister outside the ruins."
"103224356-0-55663";"I should listen to <<1>> sing."
"103224356-0-55665";"I destroyed the protective ward. Now I should enter the hidden annex and see what's waiting inside."
"103224356-0-55666";"I need to search the crypt for the entrance to the Ayleid ruin if I hope to stop the Painted Eye. Teldundindo said the entrance should be in one of the chapel's tombs."
"103224356-0-55669";"I gathered bluewhisper moth silk. I should bring it to the tailor and trade it for the formal attire we need."
"103224356-0-55674";"I entered the Ayleid ruin with Seeks-the-Dark to find the Painted Eye's leader conducting a ritual and drawing power from some kind of crystals to fuel it. They might be key to disrupting whatever the Painted Eye is doing."
"103224356-0-55681";"The letter I found indicates that the Dark Brotherhood sanctuary is somewhere inside Bloodrun Cave. I should meet Eveli there so we can renew our investigation."
"103224356-0-55682";"I reached the site of the Ayleid ruin marked on the map. I should enter Ne Salas and look for another Imperial cache."
"103224356-0-55683";"I should visit these places and overcome challenges there.\n\nCraglorn world events include Anka-Ra burial sites, magical Anomalies, and Nirncrux mines."
"103224356-0-55684";"I completed tasks in each of the places the notice mentioned. I should report the result of my adventures to <<1>>."
"103224356-0-55690";"We found a crack in the cave wall that led to some sort of ancient ruin. Eveli thinks we may have found the entrance to the sanctuary. I should talk to her before we proceed."
"103224356-0-55693";"A Wood Elf named Eveli Sharp-Arrow confronted me just inside Ne Salas. I should talk to her."
"103224356-0-55695";"Eveli thinks the black door ahead of us leads to the Dark Brotherhood sanctuary. I should examine the door and try to open it. Maybe the letter I found will help with that."
"103224356-0-55696";"I should search the Ne Salas ruin and see if I can find another Imperial cache."
"103224356-0-55708";"Eveli killed the cultist scholar before she could break the ward protecting the cache. I should use Lyranth's amulet and try to destroy the ward."
"103224356-0-55712";"We lowered the bridge. Now we should go across it and continue exploring the vault."
"103224356-0-55715";"Eveli wants to try to open the cache. I should wait and see what happens."
"103224356-0-55716";"The Imperial cache contained Emperor Leovic's signet ring and a scroll written in some sort of Imperial code. I should talk to Eveli and show her what I found."
"103224356-0-55717";"Lyranth opened a portal to take us to Elden Root so we can meet Eveli's contact. I should use the portal now."
"103224356-0-55718";"Eveli thinks she has someone who can help us decipher the coded scroll. I should inform Lyranth and see if she made any progress with the sealed scroll we found in the other annex."
"103224356-0-55719";"Eveli introduced me to her contact, Beragon. I should show him the coded Imperial scroll and see if he can decipher it."
"103224356-0-55727";"We opened the black door. Now to enter the sanctuary and see what we can find."
"103224356-0-55728";"Elam Drals and a few other Dark Brotherhood assassins were waiting for us inside. I should talk to him."
"103224356-0-55729";"The Order of the Waking Flame cultists have invaded the sanctuary. I need to explore the rest of the installation and figure out what's going on here."
"103224356-0-55731";"<<1>> told me she's looking for the sword, armor, and helm of Phalevon the Magnificent. I should search for the hero's relics."
"103224356-0-55733";"I gathered three worn relics from Phalevon's tomb. I should check with <<1>> and see what's next."
"103224356-0-55734";"<<1>> explained that the last and most important of the relics she seeks, <<2>>, remains missing … and might be cursed. I should search deeper in Undertow Cavern."
"103224356-0-55735";"I should get more information from <<1>> about how to go about setting up a prank."
"103224356-0-55736";"I should look for the <<1>> in <<2>> and carry out the prank."
"103224356-0-55737";"I need to pick up a Prank Kit at <<1>>'s workshop."
"103224356-0-55738";"I need to place the prank book without <<1>> noticing."

"103224356-0-56061";"Alchemy and I found a few things around the fort but nothing obviously pointing to Annyce's whereabouts. They have inspired Alchemy, however, and she seems to be channeling Annyce's motivations."

"103224356-0-56133";"Iulius wants me to steal a business ledger to help release the Fang-Furls' grip on Blackwood's trade. I may be able to find one in the home of the gang's bookkeeper, but I will need to be stealthy."
"103224356-0-56134";"Scipion Averno wants to take a look at the Fang-Furls' ledger I stole. I should speak with him."
"103224356-0-56135";"I need to draw out the leader of the Fang-Furls, Pungent Adder. After looking at the ledger, Scipion suggested I befoul his prized cask of wine at the Leyawiin docks, and also sabotage numerous dead drops around the Blackwood region."

"103224356-0-56164";"Apparently, Faric carries a rare bauble called a memory stone. He believes that if we take the stone to the right place, it will conjure up a memory for us to observe. We should start our investigation on the ground floor."
"103224356-0-56165";"When we entered a room on the Dibellaseum's ground floor, the memory stone resonated. I should try to activate it and observe the results."
"103224356-0-56166";"The memory stone revealed a horrific vision of a shadowy figure murdering someone in the Dibellaseum. I should speak with Faric about what we witnessed."
"103224356-0-56167";"We know the memory stone contains a visual record of at least one murder. We should search the second floor of the Dibellaseum for more memories."
"103224356-0-56168";"The memory stone flashed again. I should use it to conjure up another memory."
"103224356-0-56169";"We witnessed another gruesome murder. Someone definitely killed the novitiates here in the Dibellaseum. There might be more to learn on the top floor. We should take the memory stone upstairs."

"103224356-0-56171";"Repeating the killer's gestures revealed a strange portal  in the wall. I should step through and see where it leads."

"103224356-0-56176";"The unidentified killer murdered the novitiates and trapped their souls in black soul gems. This same person may have murdered Priestess Rolaine. With luck, the map we discovered will lead us to Rolaine's missing carriage."
"103224356-0-56177";"We found the mud-caked wreckage of a carriage in a pool of water. I should examine the skeleton and chest inside."
"103224356-0-56178";"I found a ring on the skeleton and black soul gems in the chest. I should show Faric what I've found."
"103224356-0-56179";"Shortly after we discovered Priestess Rolaine's remains, a ghost appeared across the pond. I should see what the ghost wants."
"103224356-0-56180";"The ghost seems to want me to follow it. I should see where it leads."
"103224356-0-56181";"The ghost led me to a small cave. Inside, I found another skeleton and a remarkably well-preserved scroll. I should examine both."
"103224356-0-56182";"I found Cerise's final words committed to paper. Priestess Rolaine was the killer, and Cerise died stopping her. I should tell Faric the news."
"103224356-0-56183";"With the ledger, Cerise's written testimony, the memories saved in the memory stone, the black soul gems, and Rolaine's signet ring, we now have proof that Cerise died a hero. If I bring this evidence to Fire-From-Nowhere we can clear Cerise's name."
"103224356-0-56184";"Fire-From-Nowhere has promised to make the truth about Priestess Rolaine and Cerise known to all, no matter the controversy it causes. He will also protect Faric Gemain. My work is complete, but I should speak to Faric one last time."

"103224356-0-56190";"One of the Dibella priests said that Sombren and Calia have left the temple. I should ask her if she knows where they went."
"103224356-0-56191";"The priest of Dibella told me that Sombren and Calia went off to some ruin outside Gideon. I should go look for them there."
"103224356-0-56193";"The Dibella priest said Sombren and Calia went to a ruin just north of the city. I should be able to find them there."
"103224356-0-56194";"I found Sombren and Calia. It appears that Sombren is doing something with the Mysterium Xarxes. I should talk to him."
"103224356-0-56195";"Sombren and Calia decided to go to the Deadlands. Sombren thinks he can safely teach her to control her power there. I should talk to Eveli before we return to Gideon."

"103224356-0-56211";"We found Quistley in Daggerfall. Bastian doesn't really trust him, and doesn't trust himself to keep his temper around Quistley. I should speak to Quistley and see what this is all about."
"103224356-0-56212";"Quistley has an old letter for Bastian from a Hallix family servant. But he won't part with it until Bastian retrieves a family heirloom that Quistley gambled away to a bandit from Illessan Tower."
"103224356-0-56213";"Somewhere within Illessan Tower is Grenetta, the gambler who won the Silvelle ring from Quistley. We need to find her to get the ring back for Quistley."
"103224356-0-56214";"We found Grenetta … dead. Fortunately, the Silvelles' heirloom ring was close by. Now to return it to Quistley so that Bastian can get the letter Quistley found about Lady Hallix."
"103224356-0-56217";"Quistley took the Silvelle ring and left Bastian the letter he found in Lord Silvelle's papers. Bastian asked me to read the letter. He's afraid to."
"103224356-0-56218";"The letter was written by Inalieth, a servant employed by Lady Hallix. She looked after Bastian when his mother died and was supposed to take him to his sister. I need to talk to Bastian."
"103224356-0-56219";"The old letter to Bastian came from a Hallix family servant named Inalieth. Bastian wants to go to Redfur Trading Post in Grahtwood, where she went to work after the Silvelles dismissed her."
"103224356-0-56220";"Inalieth's letter is more than ten years old. Bastian hopes that she still lives in Redfur Trading Post. We should start by asking someone at the inn."
"103224356-0-56221";"We learned that Inalieth was fired from the Hearty Hoarvor, perhaps unfairly. She told a fellow employee that she was heading out into the Grahtwood. We should find her."
"103224356-0-56222";"We found Inalieth near Redfur. Bastian is worried that she might want nothing more to do with Hallixes and Silvelles. He wants me to ask her what she remembers."
"103224356-0-56223";"Inalieth cleared up some of the mystery about how Bastian ended up with the Silvelles. Yet there are questions that remain unanswered. I should talk to him about what comes next."
"103224356-0-56224";"We found Inalieth, an old Hallix family servant, who cleared up some of the mystery of how Bastian ended up with the Silvelles. I should talk to him about all of this."

"103224356-0-56241";"There are still three others missing from Mirri's party. We need to continue our search for more of the cult's rituals."
"103224356-0-56242";"Mirri spotted Ghalor, one of the other missing adventurers, but something is obviously wrong with him and she's shaken by it. She asked that I examine him."
"103224356-0-56243";"Ghalor is completely glassy-eyed and unresponsive to my presence. I should speak to Mirri about it."
"103224356-0-56258";"The shade of the killer approached a nearby wall and cast some sort of magic spell. Faric suggested I try to mimic the murderer's gestures to reveal any secrets hidden within the wall."

"103224356-0-56284";"I should inform Commander Ortin about Councilor Abor and let him know there was no sign of the servant in the watchtower."
"103224356-0-56285";"Bastian asked me to accompany him to Wayrest. He hopes to find Count Elmonde Auzin, his sister's husband. Bastian thinks it might be wise to see what he knows before surprising a sister he's never met."
"103224356-0-56286";"We found Count Auzin at an inn in Wayrest. He looks rather distraught about something. I should speak to him."
"103224356-0-56287";"Count Auzin told us that Bastian's sister was captured by slavers near Koeglin Village. He asked us to rescue her. We should go to Koeglin and find the slavers."

"103224356-0-56291";"Bastian and his sister Clairene are strangers to each other. A meeting such as this is something I need to see."

"103224356-0-56295";"Count Auzin allowed Bastian's sister to believe he was dead—but that isn't important at the moment. Clairene has been captured by slavers. I should talk to Bastian about what we've learned."
"103224356-0-56296";"We rescued Clairene from the slavers in Koeglin Mine. I should talk to her and tell her that Bastian is her long-lost younger brother."

"103224356-0-56396";"While it wasn't the reunion they might have hoped, Mirri is content with the outcome. I should see what she wants to do now that the matter is concluded."

"103224356-0-56758";"Lyranth has Eveli looking through the notes of the Longhouse Emperors. I need to meet her in Fargrave's Plaza of Portals to see if she's learned anything new."
"103224356-0-56759";"Lyranth used the portal key. Now that I'm disguised as Devastator Rullen of the Order of the Waking Flame, I should step through the portal and find out what the Dagonists are up to."
"103224356-0-56760";"The portal deposited us in a cave. I should explore and see if I can figure out where we are."
"103224356-0-56764";"Lyranth tasked Eveli with combing through the Longhouse Emperors' documents we found to see if she could learn anything new about the Fourth Ambition. I should talk to her and see what she uncovered."
"103224356-0-56765";"The portal key was supposed to lead us to some sort of Waking Flame base. I need to find the cultists and turn over Lyranth so we can execute our plan."
"103224356-0-56766";"We encountered a sentry who recognized me as the Waking Flame cultist I'm disguised as. I should talk to her."
"103224356-0-56767";"The sentry directed me to Sister Celdina. I should find her and present Lyranth to her so we can advance our plan."
"103224356-0-56768";"Sister Celdina is addressing other members of the cult. It appears she's one of their leaders, at least of this cell of the order. I should talk to her and present Lyranth as my prisoner."
"103224356-0-56769";"Sister Celdina took Lyranth and headed for the cataclyst chamber. I should head inside and get ready for whatever Lyranth has planned."
"103224356-0-56773";"I should move forward and approach the Fargrave cataclyst."
"103224356-0-56774";"Sister Celdina has given me the privilege of activating the Fargrave cataclyst and Lyranth has signaled that she's ready. I should activate the device now."
"103224356-0-56775";"I need to defeat the Havocrel and then follow Lyranth out of here."
"103224356-0-56776";"Now that the Havocrel has been defeated, I need to find Lyranth so we can return to Nirn."
"103224356-0-56777";"Lyranth opened a portal back to the Marbruk Outlaws Refuge. I should enter it."
"103224356-0-56779";"Since Eveli's search didn't turn up anything new and Lyranth hasn't figured out where to go to find Sombren and Calia, she wants us to meet her at the House of Whims so we can investigate the Anchorite's memories next."
"103224356-0-56782";"Before Kastav died, he told me that the Ravener finds prey using an orb powered by blood. Occasionally he heard the creature roar from a tower in the north. I should search around to see if I can learn anything more."
"103224356-0-56787";"I entered a drainage grate and found Khazasha waiting inside the Daedric citadel. We should follow Atrozu closely as he tracks the Ravener."
"103224356-0-56789";"We escaped Ardent Hope with our lives, but at the cost of Khazasha's totem spirit, Atrozu. I should speak with her for my reward."
"103224356-0-56791";"I should speak to Selveni about what just happened."
"103224356-0-56792";"Selveni said he would meet me inside the False Martyrs' Folly."
"103224356-0-56793";"Everyone is present and Madam Whim is ready to begin the ritual to pull forth the Anchorite's memories. I should follow her instructions and retrieve the memory vessel."
"103224356-0-56794";"I need to take the memory fragments from the Anchorite as Madam Whim performs the ritual."
"103224356-0-56798";"Selveni has three magical rocks called the Mother Stones that he needs to fill with power from energy fonts in the Folly. He said that we should start looking for the fonts in the northwest."
"103224356-0-56799";"The ritual to recover the Anchorite's memories did not go as expected. I should speak to Madam Whim to see if she can give us any information on the memory fragments we were able to collect."
"103224356-0-56800";"I met the Anchorite at the Brandfire Reformatory. Now to use the Anchorite's amulet to locate the soul of Emperor Moricar."
"103224356-0-56816";"We followed the wisp produced by the amulet to a hidden door. We need to enter it and see where it leads."
"103224356-0-56817";"The Anchorite and I went through the hidden door. Now we need to look around and figure out where we are."
"103224356-0-56820";"The only thing we see inside the open furnace is a chunk of iron slag. I should examine it."
"103224356-0-56821";"The Anchorite and I heard voices from inside the furnace. We need to figure out a way to open the furnace door."
"103224356-0-56822";"When I examined the slag, the voice of Emperor Moricar emanated from inside it. The Anchorite wants to talk to me before we attempt anything else."
"103224356-0-56823";"The Anchorite believes we can free the souls from the metal slag by melting it down. To do that, I need to activate the furnace."
"103224356-0-56824";"Now that I have the mysterious substance, I should find Noroth at the town hall in the spire."
"103224356-0-56825";"Noroth wants me to talk to Faven. I should ask him what he spoke to Tephilaz about before he died."
"103224356-0-56829";"Lyranth suggests we bring Arox the Mutilator with us to find the Bladebearer clan. I should talk to Arox."
"103224356-0-56830";"Our search of the Deadlands uncovered Nokvroz's plans to create his own cataclyst, located Elegian, and determined the hiding place of Sister Celdina's Riven Cataclyst. We still haven't found the missing Bladebearers, but we have a new destination."
"103224356-0-56831";"Lyranth told me to gather Arox and prepare myself for the journey to Annihilarch's Summit. I should talk to the daedrat and have him hop into my pack."
"103224356-0-56832";"We rescued the missing Bladebearers, defeated a new Incarnate, and destroyed the Riven Cataclyst. Sister Celdina escaped, but we dealt the Order of the Waking Flame a serious setback. I should talk to Lyranth about what's next."
"103224356-0-56833";"Lyranth suggested we seek out Rynkyus of the Bladebearer clan. He might know how a Bladebearer's sword ended up in Burning Gyre Keep. I should meet her at Wretched Spire, in the Sever section of the Deadlands."
"103224356-0-56834";"I caught up to Lyranth in Wretched Spire and found her speaking with Rynkyus of the Bladebearer clan. She wants me to talk to him."
"103224356-0-56835";"Rynkyus told me that his clan sent scouts to look for his missing clan members. The scouts did not report back from two locations. Rynkyus wants to investigate."
"103224356-0-56836";"The Xivilai Zynoahz oversees a gaol somewhere in the Burn. Rynkyus will meet me nearby."
"103224356-0-56839";"Rynkyus and I found a number of clues in Jynd's foundry and Zynoahz's gaol, but we're no closer to learning the location of the Riven Cataclyst. Fortunately, Lyranth and the Anchorite have something to share."
"103224356-0-56843";"Faven mentioned someone named Vontan that Tephilaz was concerned with. He lives in the Fleapits, a district of Wretched Spire. I should go speak with him to find out what he knows."
"103224356-0-56844";"I entered the Fleapits district, a dangerous worn-down shanty town outside of Wretched Spire. I should try to find Vontan to interrogate him."
"103224356-0-56847";"I arrived at Vontan's home just in time to watch him die. Perhaps something in the area could offer clues. I should search for anything that can tell us about his connection to Tephilaz."
"103224356-0-56848";"I told Noroth about the Waking Flame infiltrating the town. He says he must inform Faven so he can start a defense. I should go to town hall and speak to Faven."
"103224356-0-56849";"I found several documents at Vontan's hovel that claim the Order of the Waking Flame have infiltrated Wretched Spire and that a local is assisting them. I should relay this to Noroth."
"103224356-0-56850";"Someone murdered Faven. While Noroth translates the documents I found, I should search for clues."
"103224356-0-56851";"I should speak with Noroth to let him know what I found at the crime scene, and to find out if he learned anything from the evidence found at Vontan's."
"103224356-0-56852";"Noroth was able to decipher the location of the Waking Flame's nearby camp. It's located southwest of town. I should head there at once."
"103224356-0-56853";"I located the Waking Flame's camp outside Wretched Spire. I should enter it immediately."
"103224356-0-56854";"I entered the Waking Flame camp. I should search for evidence that will implicate the ones responsible for the murders."
"103224356-0-56855";"I defeated the frightening Daedra and the machine that gave birth to it has ceased to function. Lucilla wishes to speak with me now that the mission is over."
"103224356-0-56856";"After we melted the slag, the souls of the Longhouse Emperors appeared before us. I should speak to Emperor Moricar."
"103224356-0-56858";"This was clearly a gathering room of sorts. I should be able to find the evidence I'm looking for here."
"103224356-0-56860";"I discovered some of the same toxic substance that killed Tephilaz, as well as a note that appears to be from the culprit. I should continue searching the base to find the murderer."
"103224356-0-56861";"I overheard Tarvyn admit to the murders. I should find him and make sure he is brought to justice."
"103224356-0-56862";"Tarvyn admitted he killed Tephilaz, Vontan, and his father. Now that I have him cornered, I should speak with him to find out why he committed all these murders."
"103224356-0-56863";"The foundry of Kynmarcher Jynd is somewhere in the Sever. I should meet Rynkyus there to investigate Nokvroz's Dremora underling."
"103224356-0-56864";"Rynkyus waited for me outside of Kynmarcher Jynd's foundry. I should speak with him before we go inside."
"103224356-0-56866";"We learned that the cataclyst plans are the work of a blind seer. The Anchorite recalled a name: Elegian. Arox claims that Elegian is held prisoner in a place called the Blood Pit. I should talk to Arox."
"103224356-0-56875";"We found a way inside Deadlight Citadel and came upon an archive of old relics and writings related to the Order of the Waking Flame. I should see if there's anything that might interest Lyranth hidden among the trove."
"103224356-0-56876";"We uncovered several writings that relate to the creation of the cataclysts and the secrets of the Waking Flame cult. I should discuss the implications of these items with the Anchorite."
"103224356-0-56877";"The writings we found in the archives revealed that Sister Celdina intends to help Mehrunes Dagon destroy the mortal world, but we haven't found her yet. We need to keep searching the Deadlight Citadel."
"103224356-0-56878";"We entered a shrine deep inside the citadel. The Anchorite seems to recognize this place, and she feels a connection between the altar in the center of the chamber and the amulet Elegian gave her. I should examine the altar."
"103224356-0-56879";"The Anchorite thinks there may be a connection between her amulet and this altar. I should talk to her about that."
"103224356-0-56880";"The Anchorite channeled her magic into the amulet Elegian gave her. She suspects that the items around the shrine will reveal her memories of this place. I should examine these items."
"103224356-0-56881";"The magic of the amulet showed me key memories related to items from the Anchorite's past. What will the amulet reveal if I examine it directly?"
"103224356-0-56883";"According to the Anchorite's released memories, she's the daughter of Emperor Moricar and Sister Celdina. She was created to help Mehrunes Dagon destroy the world, but Elegian helped her escape. I should talk to her about all this."
"103224356-0-56884";"Still reeling from the ordeal of having her memories flood back, the Anchorite—Mairead—ran off to confront her mother, Sister Celdina. I should follow after her."
"103224356-0-56885";"It sounds like the Anchorite and Sister Celdina are just up ahead. I should keep going and intervene before it's too late."
"103224356-0-56886";"I must defeat Sister Celdina. Her plans to use the Anchorite to help Mehrunes Dagon destroy Nirn must be stopped, no matter what."
"103224356-0-56887";"I defeated Sister Celdina, but Valkynaz Nokvroz appeared and captured the Anchorite. It looks like she dropped her amulet. I should retrieve it for safekeeping."
"103224356-0-56888";"Valkynaz Nokvroz's forces are swarming Deadlight Citadel, but Lyranth just opened a portal nearby. I'd better leave while I can."
"103224356-0-56891";"Lyranth opened a portal and Sombren, Calia, and Eveli stepped through. Sombren seems angry with the Longhouse Emperors' souls. I should wait and see what happens next."
"103224356-0-56892";"Eveli wants to talk to me about what just happened. I should speak to her."
"103224356-0-56893";"I discovered several interesting items: a disintegrating claw from the Ravener, Kastav's journal which mentions the Ravener losing his strength, and blood on the pedestal that held the orb. I should bring this information to Khazasha."
"103224356-0-56894";"I gave Khazasha the items I found, which strengthened her determination to take revenge. Atrozu once again found the Ravener's trail and began to chase it. I should follow the ghostly bear to find our prey."
"103224356-0-56895";"Atrozu continues to track the Ravener, but a locked gate blocks our path. I should search the area to find a way around."
"103224356-0-56898";"Emperor Moricar's spirit said the Longhouse Emperors had a contingency plan in case Mehrunes Dagon failed to live up to his part of their bargain. He said we could find the details at a retreat in the Deadlands called the Isle of Joys."
"103224356-0-56899";"Rynkyus said he would be waiting for me outside of Kynmarcher Jynd's foundry near an old shrine. We should compare notes."
"103224356-0-56901";"I found Rynkyus waiting for me outside Zynoahz's gaol. I should speak with him before we venture inside."
"103224356-0-56906";"I discovered a tunnel burrowed through the courtyard wall. It's just wide enough that we can crawl through. I should use it to bypass the locked gate and continue tracking the Ravener."
"103224356-0-56907";"I met Eveli at the Isle of Joys. Now to look around and try to find the details of the Longhouse Emperors' contingency plan so we can use it against Mehrunes Dagon."
"103224356-0-56908";"We made it through the tunnel and into the courtyard of a large tower. I should continue pursuing the Ravener's trail."
"103224356-0-56914";"I should discuss what we found on the Isle of Joys with Eveli."
"103224356-0-56916";"Emperor Moricar's journal indicates that the key to the egonymic, his contingency plan against Mehrunes Dagon, can be found in the Anchorite's vault in northern Blackwood. I should meet Eveli there."
"103224356-0-56917";"Eveli and I need to look around the vault and see if we can find any clues as to the Longhouse Emperors' plan."
"103224356-0-56918";"Strange runes appeared when Eveli and I got close to the location indicated on the map. The runes are similar to those etched into the ring we found. I should see if there's a connection."
"103224356-0-56919";"The portal brought Eveli and me to a hidden chamber. We need to look around."
"103224356-0-56922";"Atrozu sounds worried, and Khazasha appears concerned about our hunt. She paused and asked to speak with me. I should listen to what she has to say."
"103224356-0-56926";"Lyranth appeared and she's distressed about something. I should speak with her and find out what's wrong."
"103224356-0-56927";"Lyranth says Sombren has the Anchorite and Calia and is attempting to take their power. I should travel to Annihilarch's Summit with her and try to stop to him."
"103224356-0-56931";"Sombren is trying to force Calia and the Anchorite to go with him. I need to stop him."
"103224356-0-56932";"I defeated the echo of Destron that Sombren called forth. Then the Anchorite banished Sombren. It's time to return to Fargrave and determine our next move."
"103224356-0-56935";"Now that the Mother Stones have been attuned to the energy of the Sever, I should speak to Selveni to find out what our next step is."
"103224356-0-56936";"Selveni told me that there is an altar in the Folly that we can use to locate the statues where the spirits are trapped. We need to find the altar first."
"103224356-0-56938";"Khazasha grows more obsessed with destroying the Ravener. She refuses to leave until she has her revenge. I should lead her and Atrozu up the tower until we find the creature."
"103224356-0-56942";"We reached a dead end but found a room with a strange machine. Khazasha believes activating it will allow us to proceed. I should find the missing components and turn it on."
"103224356-0-56945";"I returned to the House of Whims in Fargrave. Now I should talk to Lyranth and tell her what happened to the Anchorite."
"103224356-0-56948";"I found Sombren's diary, He must have left it behind when he and Calia visited this place. I should tell Eveli what it says."
"103224356-0-56949";"Activating the machine opened a portal. Khazasha's intuition tells her that we must enter it to find the Ravener. I should go through the portal to continue our hunt."
"103224356-0-56951";"Beyond the portal, we found an ornate room that looks like a ritual chamber. At the center is a lectern displaying a book. I should read the book for any clues."
"103224356-0-56952";"The book describes the Ravener's vow to hunt down Atrozu and devour him. It cannot stop until the hunt is complete. Khazasha appears distraught from this news. I should talk to her and learn her thoughts."
"103224356-0-56953";"Madam Whim used the Anchorite's memory fragments to scry the location of the soul of the Longhouse Emperor, Moricar. The Anchorite and I need to travel to the Brandfire Reformatory in the Deadlands to determine the significance of this memory."
"103224356-0-56954";"Khazasha thinks that destroying the scrying orb should stop the Ravener from finding Atrozu. Perhaps starving it will destroy the creature. I should leave the vow chamber to continue exploring the tower."
"103224356-0-56959";"I obtained the fluster fume root and tincture of befuddlement. I should return to the Marbruk Outlaws Refuge and give them to Lyranth."
"103224356-0-56960";"I returned to Lyranth and she ordered me to add the fluster fume root and the tincture of befuddlement in the cauldron."
"103224356-0-56965";"After leaving the vow chamber, we entered a large courtyard with ponds of lava. Atrozu warned us that the Ravener may be near. I should move quickly to find the scrying orb."
"103224356-0-56978";"The notice directed me to talk to Hewlet Hexos in the city of Fargrave for more details."
"103224356-0-56979";"I should ask Hewlet Hexos how I go about signing up for one of these daily jobs."
"103224356-0-56980";"I can see the Ravener's scrying orb just past a closed metal gate. I should enter so we can deal with the orb and destroy the Ravener for good."
"103224356-0-56981";"I should return to Luna Beriel and let her know that I destroyed the propaganda the Waking Flame Cult created."
"103224356-0-56982";"I should return to Luna Beriel and let her know I found the relics for appraisal."
"103224356-0-56983";"I should return to Luna Beriel and let her know I found the valuables."
"103224356-0-56984";"I should return to Luna and let her know I found the martyrs' copperleaf she requested."
"103224356-0-56985";"I should return to Luna Beriel and let her know that I delivered the letters."
"103224356-0-56986";"I should return to Luna Beriel and bring her the goods I recovered from the Shambles."
"103224356-0-56987";"Lyranth's potion of disguise is ready. I should drink it while she prepares to use the portal key to open a portal."
"103224356-0-56994";"Khazasha asked for council on how to deal with the scrying orb. I advised leaving it intact so that Atrozu stays with her, even though it means the Ravener stays alive. I should pour this vial of her blood on it to drain its power so we can escape."
"103224356-0-56995";"Inside the lair, we found the scrying orb on top an ornate pedestal. I should get closer to examine it."
"103224356-0-56996";"Khazasha asked me to decide how to deal with the scrying orb. I recommended destroying it despite the cost of losing Atrozu. She regretfully agreed. I should smash the orb once she starts draining it."
"103224356-0-57000";"We have destroyed the Ravener's scrying orb, dooming it to starvation. Khazasha used what remains of her power to open an escape portal. I should go through it to leave Ardent Hope."
"103224356-0-57002";"Arox told me that the seer we need to speak with is a prisoner in the Blood Pit. The Anchorite will meet us there."
"103224356-0-57003";"I should continue to explore the Blood Pit as I search for Elegian, the blind seer."
"103224356-0-57006";"Selveni asked me to make the choice between freeing Ordinator Nilera or Grandmother Sovisa Andalor for him. I should find their statues and choose one."
"103224356-0-57008";"Arox suggested that we search the Warden's Overlook. Something there may point us to the location of Elegian's cell."
"103224356-0-57009";"We found a prisoner list and the warden's instructions at the Warden's Overlook. Elegian is held in a part of the prison called the Durance Vile and guarded by Fivax the Oppressor."
"103224356-0-57010";"We entered the Durance Vile, but Elegian's cell is blocked by a glowing door. I should talk to the Anchorite and see if she has any ideas on how to open it."
"103224356-0-57012";"We unlocked the cell where we believe Elegian is being held. Time to meet the mad genius who supposedly designed the Riven Cataclyst."
"103224356-0-57013";"We found the blind seer Elegian. He doesn't seem well. The Anchorite wants me to talk to him."
"103224356-0-57015";"We heard Valkynaz Nokvroz mention an elixir. We think they use it to clear Elegian's mind when they interrogate him. There are several bottles strewn about in this cell, but which one is the right elixir?"
"103224356-0-57016";"Pouring the elixir on the braziers created fumes that seem to have cleared Elegian's head. I should talk to him before the effect wears off."
"103224356-0-57017";"Elegian told us that the Riven Cataclyst is hidden at Annihilarch's Summit. I should return to Wretched Spire and report this news to Lyranth and Rynkyus."
"103224356-0-57018";"We returned from the Blood Pit with information about the Riven Cataclyst's location: it's hidden at Annihilarch's Summit. We also learned something about the Anchorite's mask. I should talk to Lyranth and let her know what we learned."
"103224356-0-57024";"I need to figure out how to activate the device that will unseal the door to Elegian's prison cell. The Anchorite suggested I gather lucents, and I can always ask her for more information if I need to."
"103224356-0-57028";"I found a green tonic that doesn't seem to be poisonous or disgusting. I should pour it into the braziers and see if the fumes clear Elegian's mind."
"103224356-0-57029";"Lyranth believes we can use the Waking Flame portal key to open a way into Ardent Hope. I need to talk to Madam Whim to see if she will help us re-attune the key to this location."
"103224356-0-57030";"Madam Whim agreed to attune the Waking Flame portal key. I need to meet her at an old portal dais in the Deadlands, in the Burn and south of Ardent Hope."
"103224356-0-57031";"Madam Whim needs me to reawaken the old portal dais while she works on re-attuning the key. I need to turn the Daedric stones so they match the nearby runes."
"103224356-0-57032";"The portal dais has been activated. I should talk to Madam Whim and retrieve the portal key."
"103224356-0-57033";"The Anchorite asked me to place the relic on the table so she can study it further."
"103224356-0-57034";"The relic seemed to react to the Anchorite's presence. I should pay attention to what secrets it reveals."
"103224356-0-57035";"The relic contained a message from Emperor Moricar about the egonymic and the creation of the Ambitions. The egonymic is Mehrunes Dagon's true name and each Ambition holds one of the four pieces. I should see what Lyranth thinks."
"103224356-0-57036";"Lucilla has decided to take Martus's judgment into her own hands. I should speak to her about what comes next."
"103224356-0-57037";"With the dais activated and the portal key in hand, we can now use this portal to reach the interior of Ardent Hope, Valkynaz Nokvroz's fortress."
"103224356-0-57041";"Now that we know what the egonymic is and what it is used for, Lyranth wants us to find Sombren and recover all four parts of it. To do that, we need a guide, so I need to go to the Shambles and recruit Arox the Mutilator."
"103224356-0-57044";"I freed Arox from the Grasp. Now I need to speak with him about breaking into Destruction's Solace."

"103224356-0-57055";"I found an unusual key beside a dead cultist, and a strange twisted rod of metal. Arox seems keenly interested in the rod. I should show these items to Rynkyus and see what he thinks."

"103224356-0-57061";"Arox agreed to help us get into Destruction's Solace. We need to meet up with Lyranth in Wretched Spire."
"103224356-0-57062";"We teleported inside the walls of Ardent Hope. While Rynkyus and the Bladebearers distract the defenders with a frontal attack, we need to find a way into the inner keep."
"103224356-0-57063";"Valkynaz Nokvroz holds the Anchorite prisoner somewhere in this fortress. Now that we reached the inner keep, I should search for signs of her."
"103224356-0-57064";"We found Valkynaz Nokvroz's blood adepts with the Anchorite, her hands bound behind her. I should listen in to see what I can learn of their plans for her."
"103224356-0-57065";"The blood adepts are taking the Anchorite to the volcano where Valkynaz Nokvroz is waiting. I need to reach her before it's too late."
"103224356-0-57066";"Rynkyus and his Bladebearers are in trouble. I should talk to Lyranth and see if she has any ideas on how we can help them."

"103224356-0-57068";"I need to follow the path up the volcano and find a way inside."
"103224356-0-57069";"Nokvroz's mages defend the volcanic path with gates of fire. I can't reach the Dremora, but I can call on Arox to deal with them."
"103224356-0-57070";"Another fiery gate blocks my path up the volcano. I should summon Arox to strike down the Dremora mages who hold the gate against me."
"103224356-0-57071";"One more gate stands between me and the top of the volcanic path. More of Nokvroz's mages defend the gate. I should call on Arox to clear my way."
"103224356-0-57072";"Arox shattered the final barrier. Now to make my way to the heart of the volcano to find Valkynaz Nokvroz and the Anchorite."

"103224356-0-57075";"Valkynaz Nokvroz used his Perfected Cataclyst on himself! I need to defeat this new type of Incarnate before I can destroy the Perfected Cataclyst."
"103224356-0-57076";"Mehrunes Dagon appeared! I need to escape Ardent Hope and return to Fargrave. Luckily, Lyranth arrived to open a portal. I should use it."
"103224356-0-57077";"Lyranth's portal returned us to Fargrave. I should make my way to the House of Whims and rendezvous with my companions."
"103224356-0-57081";"With the Anchorite's help I defeated Valkynaz Nokvroz, but the last cataclyst device remains. I need to help the Anchorite shut it down for good."
"103224356-0-57087";"The gates into Destructon's Solace were unlocked and unguarded. Inside, the fortress is shrouded in a dense fog. I must lead the charge across the inner plaza."
"103224356-0-57088";"Lyranth rescued me from the fog, but the two of us are alone somewhere within Dagon's city. I should speak to her about what happened to the rest of our allies."
"103224356-0-57091";"Lyranth has left us to pursue her own goals, but I still need to defeat Sombren and keep Mehrunes Dagon from using the power of the Ambitions to conquer Nirn. I should move on and try to find my allies."
"103224356-0-57092";"I found Eveli up on the battlements. She said the Anchorite ran on ahead, through the door to the west. I should try to catch up with her."
"103224356-0-57102";"The Anchorite can sense Sombren up ahead. I should follow her in order to reach him."
"103224356-0-57108";"I should continue the journey to the summit."
"103224356-0-57109";"An imposing gate made of wind blocks the narrow passage that leads to Annihilarch's Summit. We need to open this wind-gate to proceed to the summit."
"103224356-0-57111";"The key I found beside the dead cultist opened the wind-gate. Now to continue on to the summit."
"103224356-0-57112";"We reached the summit and found a portal anchored here instead of a Waking Flame stronghold. Maybe it leads to the Riven Cataclyst. I should talk to Lyranth before going through."
"103224356-0-57113";"Lyranth is blocked from using the portal at the summit. The Anchorite and I will go through and attempt to find the Riven Cataclyst and the missing Bladebearers."
"103224356-0-57114";"The portal atop Annihilarch's Summit led us to a fort somewhere on Nirn. Wherever in the world we are, it appears to be a Waking Flame stronghold. We should look around."

"103224356-0-57116";"The Bladebearer Hadri confirmed that the cult is feeding Dremora to a device elsewhere in the fort. While Rynkyus gets them to safety, I should continue to explore."

"103224356-0-57118";"Rynkyus suggested I talk to his scout, Dothaz, and find out what he learned during his time in captivity. I should ask Dothaz about the Riven Cataclyst and what he observed in his time here."

"103224356-0-57122";"The Anchorite found a way to interfere with the Riven Cataclyst and stop it from fully empowering the Incarnate. I need to destroy the runic crux that controls the Riven Cataclyst now."
"103224356-0-57123";"The destruction of the Riven Cataclyst damaged Fort Grief. The citadel is crumbling around us, but Lyranth just opened a portal. We need to go now!"

"103224356-0-57184";"The Anchorite thinks that the cult leader, Sister Celdina, might be using the old baths in the Shambles as a headquarters. Since Lyranth seems to be hunting her, we might find her there. So it's time to head into the Shambles."

"103224356-0-57920";"I proved myself worthy and Amminus told me about the last item he needs to assemble the offering: the blessed awl. He said that a group called the Greycloaks and their monstrous leader have the awl. I should bring it back to Amminus."

"103224356-0-57930";"If the Waking Flame cult is expanding their ranks with kidnapped victims, then they must be getting closer to putting their plans into motion. I should find the Brandfire Reformatory and find out how they're turning innocents into Dagonists."

"103224356-0-57982";"Moric seems convinced that none of the bones we found belong to Privette. He holds onto hope that she's still alive. We should continue through the cave tunnels to find Moric's sheep."

"103224356-0-58018";"Valessea told me the Ascendant Order captured Guild General Quentyn, but she might have a way to track them. I need to meet Valessea back at Druid Ryvana's hut."
"103224356-0-58019";"I should speak to Valessea about finding out where the rogue knights took Guild General Quentyn."
"103224356-0-58020";"Valessea scried the location of a medallion Guild General Quentyn wore. But before we follow Quentyn's trail, we need to report back to Lady Arabelle."

"103224356-0-58039";"Now that I arrived back at camp, I should speak with Lady Arabelle."
"103224356-0-58040";"To complete the Albatross trial, we need to enter the castle catacombs. I should talk to Isobel about what to do."
"103224356-0-58041";"We set out to complete the Oaken Order trial, to find the elder wizard and retrieve his staff. I should find Isobel at a wayshrine to the east of the castle."

"103224356-0-58043";"For the Order of the Albatross, we need to retrieve a legendary lute, said to be lost in the catacombs beneath the Castle. I should meet Isobel in the chapel. The door to the catacombs is there."
"103224356-0-58044";"To win the Tourney, Isobel will need to complete three trials, corresponding to the three knightly orders of the Sapphire Coast. I should ask her about the trials before us."
"103224356-0-58045";"We need to find the wizard Erlibru's home, apparently a family friend of Isobel's. He should be the key to completing the Oaken Order trial."

"103224356-0-58082";"The commodore's diary suggests that the deep druid idols and tome would keep him and his fellows immortal if they were protected. I should search for them around Ghost Haven Bay and destroy them to break the curse."

"103224356-0-58106";"The other aspirants appear to have failed the Oaken Order trial. We should look closely at the pillars near the magic barrier to avoid the same fate."

"103224356-0-58116";"Dockmaster Arnauld doesn't seem to be home, but it looks like he left in a hurry. I should look for evidence that might tell us what happened here."
"103224356-0-58117";"We found evidence that Dockmaster Arnauld was taken by the Ascendant Order. We also found a note that confirms he was paid by the Order to overlook their smuggling and salvaging operations. I should speak to Lady Arabelle."
"103224356-0-58118";"Lady Arabelle believes that a noble may be funding the Ascendant Order. She wants to speak with Lord Bacaro Volorus at his estate, Steadfast Manor, to see if he knows of anyone who opposed the peace talks. I should meet her there."
"103224356-0-58119";"I met Lady Arabelle and Lord Bacaro at Steadfast Manor. It sounds like Lord Bacaro is worried about some retainers. I should talk to him and see if I can help."
"103224356-0-58120";"Two retainers employed by Lord Bacaro and the Society of the Steadfast are missing. With the recent attacks, the Ascendant Order might be involved. I need to look for their wagon on the road south of Steadfast Manor, between there and Castle Navire."

"103224356-0-58122";"I found one retainer dead beside the wagon, but tracks leading away from the site suggest another may have survived. I should follow the tracks and see if I can find the second retainer."
"103224356-0-58123";"The tracks appear to lead into a cave by the beach. I should head inside and see if I can locate Lord Bacaro's retainer."
"103224356-0-58125";"I see bodies ahead. It appears I'm too late to save the retainer, but I might be able to learn something if I search the area."
"103224356-0-58126";"I should report to Lord Bacaro and tell him what became of his retainers."
"103224356-0-58127";"The dockmaster's abduction and the attack on the retainers suggest that someone with wealth and power is funding the Ascendant Order. Lady Arabelle believes that might be a noble. By attending a banquet at Castle Navire, we can question a few."

"103224356-0-58129";"I arrived at the banquet at Castle Navire. I should speak with Duchess Elea Dufort, Count Damard Dufort, and Viscount Jonne Mornard. One of them may let slip something that will help us unmask the Ascendant Order leaders."

"103224356-0-58145";"Lady Arabelle has a friend who can transport us to Amenos. We're going to speak to Captain Basrush, who sails aboard a prison transport ship from the Dufort Docks."
"103224356-0-58146";"I should speak to Lady Arabelle in the courtyard behind Mandrake Manor."
"103224356-0-58147";"Lady Arabelle wants to discover where the Ascendant Order plans to meet. Reports indicate that the Order is active near Mistmouth Cave, on the northern shore of High Isle. She wants me to meet her there to investigate."
"103224356-0-58148";"Lady Arabelle and I rescued Duchess Elea and returned to Mandrake Manor to inform Lord Bacaro about the impending attack. I should talk to Lady Arabelle about what happens next."
"103224356-0-58150";"While I was aiding the alliance leaders inside All Flags Castle, it looks like Lady Arabelle and the rest of my allies handled the Ascendant Order forces outside the walls. I should talk to her."
"103224356-0-58151";"Jakarn told me Lady Arabelle has a plan to rescue the missing royals. I should go to Mandrake Manor and hear her out."
"103224356-0-58152";"I found the items Isobel asked for. Hopefully they will allow us to bypass the barrier in the Oaken Order trial."
"103224356-0-58155";"To advance in the Oaken Order trial I should ask the elder Elibru for the Oldwood Staff."
"103224356-0-58156";"Success! Elibru invited us to pick up the staff, which completes the Oaken Order trial. I should grab it."
"103224356-0-58159";"Captain Danylva led me to the invitation medallion. I should use the dispelling powder on it."
"103224356-0-58160";"I dispelled the deadly magic on the invitation medallion. I should let Captain Danylva know it's safe to present to the Skald-King now."
"103224356-0-58161";"I ran into a High Elf named Lendanor who told me he saw Louna collecting trash. She plans to make a raft and float over to Whalefall. I should search the western shore to find Louna."
"103224356-0-58162";"Louna persuaded me to join her and rescue her brother. I should take the raft she made and join her at Whalefall."
"103224356-0-58163";"Louna and I docked safely on Whalefall. It doesn't appear anyone saw us land. We should move inland and search for any clues about Anton's location."
"103224356-0-58164";"Louna and I found a sign welcoming visitors to Whalefall. Apparently Jailer Mannick runs the game of hunting prisoners. It also lists the names of six important guest hunters. I should discuss this with Louna."
"103224356-0-58166";"Louna suggested we head north toward the winner's stage mentioned on the welcome sign. We should go farther inland while searching for Anton."
"103224356-0-58167";"We found Anton tied to a post at the north of the island. I should free him quickly so that we can escape Whalefall."
"103224356-0-58168";"After leading Louna and Anton safely through the island, I should hurry and meet them at the raft to leave."
"103224356-0-58171";"Captain Danylva told me Jakarn went to Auridon. I should check the Skywatch docks for him."
"103224356-0-58172";"I arrived in Skywatch. I need to search for Jakarn."
"103224356-0-58173";"I found Jakarn. I need to update him on the situation and tell him the medallions are dangerous."
"103224356-0-58174";"The medallion is on the table nearby. I should use the dispelling powder on it."
"103224356-0-58175";"Valessea appeared as a projection and seems distressed. I should speak with her and find out what's wrong."
"103224356-0-58176";"Valessea is unable to contact Lady Arabelle. She discovered that the medallion Lady Arabelle carried is traveling to High King Emeric's retreat, Sword's Rest Isle, and chartered a boat for Jakarn and I to get there. I should head to the docks."
"103224356-0-58177";"We arrived at Sword's Rest Isle, but there's no one here. Jakarn thinks this is suspicious. We should look around and see if we can determine what's going on."
"103224356-0-58178";"The blade belonged to the first Baron Dufort. If we're going to complete the Iron Knot trial we need to research his past."
"103224356-0-58179";"We ran into one of Isobel's competitors in the Tourney, Aspirant Langley. He denied us passage on our quest to complete the Iron Knot trial. I should talk to her about our options."
"103224356-0-58181";"To complete the Iron Knot trial we have to get around Aspirant Langley. Isobel remembers another path she used to use to climb the rise when she was young."
"103224356-0-58183";"We found the path on our quest to complete the Iron Knot trial. The tome we read mentioned an old ruin where we should find the hilt to Redheart. Just have to find the ruin, now."
"103224356-0-58185";"I found the ruin where the old Duke lost his life. Now it's just a matter of finding the sword hilt for Redheart and we can claim victory in the Iron Knot trial."
"103224356-0-58186";"We found Redheart's hilt! I should follow Isobel away from the tower."
"103224356-0-58190";"I got the key from one of the knight commander's aides. Time to unlock the catacombs and complete the Albatross trial. Isobel said to meet back at the catacomb door on the lower floor of the Castle Navire Chapel."
"103224356-0-58193";"The lute, our goal in the Albatross trial, could be anywhere in these catacombs. We should search the area."
"103224356-0-58194";"It seems that one of Isobel's competitors in the Albatross trial, Aspirant Mortens, has locked himself in a small crypt. I should talk to him."
"103224356-0-58195";"The aspirant's fear of spiders has him too rattled to continue in the Albatross trial, so we left him his sword while we continued our search for the Gilded Lute."
"103224356-0-58196";"We found the Gilded Lute of Sir Brenvale for the Order of the Albatross! The bard knight met a tragic end, and now we need to make our escape from this gloomy place."
"103224356-0-58197";"I should talk to Cynric one last time."
"103224356-0-58200";"Lady Arabelle wants me to talk to Captain Basrush and convince her to transport Jakarn and I to Amenos without being noticed."
"103224356-0-58201";"Captain Basrush agreed to take us to Amenos. I should board her ship, the Shackled Guar."
"103224356-0-58202";"I freed Cynric and he offered his gratitude. I can begin the Trials of Worth to earn Lady Garick's Sacred Shield. I should enter Garick's Rest and start the first trial."
"103224356-0-58203";"Though Dame Madach lost her life, Sir Rayan and I destroyed the bloodmage's phylactery and survived the spire. I should see how the new knight is doing."
"103224356-0-58205";"Aspirant Mortens is hiding in a small crypt with the door locked behind him. We need to search for his sword in exchange for the key to get into the oldest parts of the catacombs."
"103224356-0-58207";"We retrieved Aspirant Mortens' sword. I should speak to him and retrieve the key to the old crypts."
"103224356-0-58210";"I should head inside the spire and find what awaits us within."
"103224356-0-58211";"The squire and I need to search the spire to find Dame Madach."
"103224356-0-58212";"We found Dame Madach. I should talk to her."
"103224356-0-58217";"Rayan believes the best place to look for bones is the statuary gardens hall, to the northwest. We should make our way there."
"103224356-0-58218";"Somewhere among the statuary we need to find a usable ancient bone for this mystical weapon."
"103224356-0-58224";"Somewhere within the prison warrens is an old executioner's stand. Rayan believes a block will work as the head for this unusual hammer."
"103224356-0-58229";"The waters around the spire must have something to do with turning the bloodmage's power against itself. We need to find the water mill southeast of the tower."
"103224356-0-58230";"Dame Madach is fighting the bloodmage! I should see if I can lend some assistance."
"103224356-0-58232";"Rayan, newly knighted by the late Dame Madach, wants to put an end to the bloodmage. I should help him find Bloodmage Cassel's phylactery."
"103224356-0-58233";"We made it to the bloodmage's inner chambers. I need to use the bone hammer we spent so much time creating to destroy the phylactery."
"103224356-0-58234";"Sir Rayan and I have destroyed Bloodmage Cassel once and for all. He said he'd be leaving the spire and returning to shore. I should meet him there."
"103224356-0-58235";"It seems the Ascendant Order is attacking the keep. We need to get inside and stop them."
"103224356-0-58236";"I entered the keep. I should look for any signs of Lady Arabelle, High King Emeric, or the Ascendant Champion."
"103224356-0-58238";"I destroyed the corrupted coral and freed Veslyn along with the surviving prisoners. I should return to Sergeant Brusic and see if the escapees made it out of the Coral Cliffs all right."
"103224356-0-58240";"We arrived on Amenos. Jakarn should be here somewhere. I should look around and try to find him."
"103224356-0-58241";"I found Jakarn in the Amenos prison stockade. I should talk to him."
"103224356-0-58244";"We found Lady Arabelle. I should speak with her."
"103224356-0-58245";"Lady Arabelle has a plan to deal with the mage while I engage with the Ascendant Champion. I need to enter the courtyard and prepare for battle."
"103224356-0-58246";"Lady Arabelle and Jakarn will deal with the Ascendant Order mage. Now, I need to take on the Ascendant Champion."
"103224356-0-58251";"We defeated the Ascendant Champion. Now I should talk to Lady Arabelle and make sure she's all right."
"103224356-0-58253";"Knight Commander Jourvel knighted Dame Isobel Veloise and agreed to grant her boon. She wishes to speak to us in her office."
"103224356-0-58254";"I entered Garick's Rest to find Amunara ordering some hirelings to start working. She noticed me and asked if I'm another worker. I should talk to her to find out what she wants here."
"103224356-0-58255";"I should enter the Coral Cliffs to see if I can find out what happened to the Veslyn and her prisoners."
"103224356-0-58256";"I need to search the Coral Cliffs for any signs of Veslyn or her prisoners."
"103224356-0-58257";"I found a Sea Elf just inside the Coral Cliffs. She looks frightened. Maybe she'll talk to me and tell me what's going on."
"103224356-0-58258";"Jakarn wants me to explore the jungle and look for the missing royals. He heard that the Green Serpent gang has placed a bounty and they may have a camp north of the jungle gate."
"103224356-0-58259";"I located the Green Serpent gang's camp. I should look around and see if anything here points to the location of the missing alliance leaders."
"103224356-0-58260";"Amunara told me she wants the sacred shield to improve her necromantic abilities. She plans to break down the fortress walls to get around magical wards protecting it. I should hurry to the first trial so I can win the shield."
"103224356-0-58261";"The druids are using their magic to infuse the pirate's life force into the coral outcroppings. Chyrisnia asked me to destroy the coral and save the survivors. Veslyn, if she's still alive, will be in a cage with the remaining prisoners."
"103224356-0-58268";"I learned the following things at the Green Serpent camp: One of the alliance leaders has been captured; a map showed where the gang is searching; and a big cat has been giving them trouble on the northeast shore. I should head there."
"103224356-0-58269";"I found a Senche-raht on the beach. I should talk to her."
"103224356-0-58271";"I need to go to the locations Druid Audrine marked on my map and help her cleanse the corruption spreading throughout Stonelore Grove."
"103224356-0-58272";"A nature spirit calling itself the Evergrowth took control of Druid Audrine in order to speak to me. I should listen to what the spirit has to say."
"103224356-0-58273";"Druid Audrine seems to be herself again. I should talk to her and see what she knows about the Evergrowth."
"103224356-0-58274";"Druid Audrine asked me to meet her in the village at the center of Stornelore Grove. She wants to tell her druidic circle elders what we discovered."
"103224356-0-58275";"Druid Audrine is telling the elders of her druidic circle about her encounter with the Evergrowth. I should listen in."
"103224356-0-58276";"The circle elders didn't seem quite convinced about the claims made by the Evergrowth. Druid Audrine wants me to meet her at the ritual circle right outside the village to determine our next course of action."
"103224356-0-58277";"I met Druid Audrine at the ritual circle as she requested. Now I should talk to her and see how she wants to proceed."
"103224356-0-58278";"Druid Audrine wants my help to investigate the Stonelore Grove village and see if we can find proof that one of the circle's druids is responsible for the unbalance causing the corruption. I should look around and ask questions."
"103224356-0-58279";"Druid Audrine and I discovered evidence that a druid is responsible for the unbalance that has caused the corruption. We need to present our evidence to Archdruid Agathie, who should be in the northern section of the grove."
"103224356-0-58280";"The druid involved in all this appears to be Archdruid Agathie! She disappeared before we could confront her, but the Evergrowth has once again taken control of Audrine. I should talk to the spirit."
"103224356-0-58281";"The Evergrowth explained that its darker aspect, the Allwither, is responsible for the corruption. It apparently took control of the archdruid and is using her to spread its decay. The spirit asked us to inform the elders."
"103224356-0-58282";"The Evergrowth took over Druid Audrine again. I should speak to it."
"103224356-0-58284";"The circle elders don't seem happy about it, but they gave Audrine and I permission to enter the Undergrove and do as the Evergrowth requested. I should talk to Druid Audrine before we enter the Undergrove."
"103224356-0-58285";"Druid Audrine said that the entrance to the Undergrove is in the northern part of Stonelore Grove. I should find the entrance and head inside."
"103224356-0-58286";"Several magical wards bind the Evergrowth to the grove. According to the spirit of the grove, we need to destroy these wards so that it can defend itself against the Allwither. We need to find the wards and destroy them."
"103224356-0-58287";"There's one last ward in place at the Undergrove's central chamber. I need to go there and destroy it."
"103224356-0-58288";"I made it to the Undergrove's central chamber. I should destroy the final ward and set the nature spirit free."
"103224356-0-58289";"We freed the Evergrowth and it restored balance to the grove. Now we should return to the village and talk to the circle elders."
"103224356-0-58290";"I should talk to Druid Audrine and make sure the grove is safe now."
"103224356-0-58293";"I started the Trial of Perseverance. I must fight my way through a room full of enemies to unlock several doors and make my escape. I should pass this trial so I may continue."
"103224356-0-58299";"Ember needs my help restoring the protective wards placed around Tor Draioch. The first of which is in the meadow."
"103224356-0-58300";"With the protective wards reset and working again, I should meet Scout back at Tor Draioch's tower."
"103224356-0-58301";"I should speak to Ember about everything that happened."
"103224356-0-58302";"I should speak to Ember about what I learned and also see if she found a way to curtail the motes."
"103224356-0-58303";"I found Caska on the beach and now we're searching for Queen Ayrenn. If she can pick up the queen's scent, she thinks she can lead me to her."
"103224356-0-58304";"Caska thinks she found the queen's trail! I should follow her."
"103224356-0-58307";"Cynric congratulated me on passing the first trial and told me of special tablets that will appear after each trial I pass. I should read this first one."
"103224356-0-58308";"Now that I read the tablet, I should talk to Cynric."
"103224356-0-58312";"The second test is the Trial of Wits. Cynric told me I'd find it shortly after going through a cave system. I should head through the cave to find the next trial."
"103224356-0-58313";"Armin Demalle suggested I start by speaking with Steadfast Manor's afflicted patients and one of the healers. He recommended I talk to Erebil Vules, Milagi, and Mender Teliel to gather information."
"103224356-0-58314";"I spoke to Mender Senna, one of the healers at the manor. She suggested I find Armin Demalle and ask him about this malady. I can find him at the manor's southern gate."
"103224356-0-58315";"I went to the manor's southern entrance and found a soldier there. He looks like the person Mender Senna said I should talk to."
"103224356-0-58316";"I overheard Armin Demalle arguing with someone about access to the manor's dispensary. I should talk to Armin to find out what's going on."
"103224356-0-58317";"I need to find a way into the dispensary. It's currently locked."
"103224356-0-58318";"I should look around the dispensary for anything that might shed light on what Mender Roslenn was working on."
"103224356-0-58319";"I found Mender Roslenn's journal in the manor's dispensary. I should examine it."
"103224356-0-58320";"Mender Roslenn's notes indicate that the affliction troubling the soldiers could be vampiric in nature. I should tell Armin Demalle what I found."
"103224356-0-58321";"I found Armin Demalle waiting outside the dispensary. I should speak to him about what I found."
"103224356-0-58322";"Mender Roslenn's notes make it clear she left the manor to gather harpy feathers. Armin Demalle thinks I should search for her around the nearby harpy nests."
"103224356-0-58325";"The backpack contained harpy feathers. It seems likely that Mender Roslenn either fled into the cave or was dragged inside. I should search the cave."
"103224356-0-58332";"We found Queen Ayrenn. I should speak to her."
"103224356-0-58333";"Before we find High King Emeric and Prince Irnskar, Queen Ayrenn asked me to gather some items she needs for a ritual. She wants to clear the storm so that the rescue ship can reach us more easily. She needs me to find a claw, a feather, and bones."
"103224356-0-58337";"Queen Ayrenn appeared after I found the last of the items she requires for her ritual. I should speak to her."
"103224356-0-58339";"Queen Ayrenn marked the location on my map where she last saw High King Emeric. She said she'd catch up after she prepares the items for her ritual to aid with our rescue."
"103224356-0-58340";"I reached the spot, but there's no sign of High King Emeric. Just some slain Green Serpent gang members. Queen Ayrenn arrived though, so I should talk to her."
"103224356-0-58341";"While Queen Ayrenn goes to retrieve Caska, she asked me to follow a trail of dead Green Serpents into a nearby cave. I should search the cave for any sign of High King Emeric."
"103224356-0-58343";"I found High King Emeric. I should speak to him."
"103224356-0-58344";"I should meet my allies near the old coin fort. It lies to the west of the Coral Cliffs, near the north-center of the island."
"103224356-0-58348";"I delivered the letter for Adistair, so I should return to him and see if he'll grant my request."
"103224356-0-58349";"I located my allies near the old coin fort. Caska wants to talk to me about something. I should see what she wants."
"103224356-0-58351";"High King Emeric agreed to be my prisoner, Now to see if this ruse will get us inside the old coin fort."
"103224356-0-58353";"High King Emeric will draw out the sentries at the gate. I need to follow his lead."
"103224356-0-58354";"Now that I'm inside the inner keep, I need to find Prince Irnskar."
"103224356-0-58355";"I found Prince Irnskar. I should speak to him."
"103224356-0-58356";"Prince Irnskar heard that the leadership of the Ascendant Order is somewhere inside the fort. We should try to find the Ascendant Lord and the Magus."
"103224356-0-58357";"The Ascendant Magus is speaking with his superior, the Ascendant Lord. I should listen to what they say."
"103224356-0-58359";"The Ascendant Order has mustered to attack us. I need to defend Prince Irnskar."
"103224356-0-58360";"I need to find a way outside so I can signal the ship."
"103224356-0-58361";"I need to defend Queen Ayrenn while she calms the storm so the ship can safely reach shore."
"103224356-0-58363";"The signal is lit. Now I need to get down to the shore and find Queen Ayrenn and High King Emeric."
"103224356-0-58364";"We rescued the alliance leaders and escaped the Green Serpent's lair. Now to board the ship and leave Amenos."
"103224356-0-58365";"I escaped Amenos and the alliance leaders are safe. Time to return to Mandrake Manor and report in to Lady Arabelle."
"103224356-0-58366";"Jakarn says that Lady Arabelle has a task for me. I should go to Mandrake Manor and talk to her."
"103224356-0-58367";"I need to investigate the three sites marked on the map I found at Castle Navire—the Dufort Shipyards, Stonelore Grove, and a cave near Tor Draioch. Jakarn, Captaiin Kaleen, and Valessea will meet me at the sites."
"103224356-0-58368";"I learned what I could from the locations marked on Duchess Elea's map. I should report back to Lady Arabelle at Mandrake Manor and give her the information."
"103224356-0-58369";"Lady Arabelle sent me to Shipwreck Shoals to respond to Captain Tsuzo's message that requested help. I should go there and find him."
"103224356-0-58370";"I reached Shipwreck Shoals. Now to find Captain Tsuzo."
"103224356-0-58371";"I found Captain Tsuzo. I should speak to him and see what sort of help he needed."
"103224356-0-58372";"Captains Tsuzo found the wreckage of his ship, Kamal's Bane. His ship was carrying Prince Irnskar of Skyrim. I should search the wreckage for any clues as to what happened to the prince."
"103224356-0-58373";"I found a survivor among the wreckage. I should speak to her."
"103224356-0-58374";"Islinne told me that Prince Irnskar saved her from the sinking ship, but he was washed toward the island of Amenos. I have to inform Lady Arabelle."
"103224356-0-58375";"I need to update Lady Arabelle about what Boatswain Islinne told me at Shipwreck Shoals."
"103224356-0-58392";"I made it to the Trial of Wits. Cynric said there's a four-part story on tablets in the room that I'll need to use to light four braziers to pass the trial."
"103224356-0-58397";"We retrieved the Prowler. Now I should speak with Captain Jimila."
"103224356-0-58399";"I found a vampire imprisoned in the cave. She's asking for help. I should speak with her."
"103224356-0-58400";"The vampire Seraphyne is a victim of Master Healer Viralaine's mad experiments. She promised to help save Roslenn by giving me her blood if I release her. I should get the vial of blood."
"103224356-0-58401";"I have the components I need to make the cure. I should create it at the alchemy table nearby."
"103224356-0-58402";"I created the cure. I should use it on Roslenn to wake her."
"103224356-0-58403";"The cure worked on Mender Roslenn and woke her up. I should talk to her."
"103224356-0-58406";"Jakarn said Lady Arabelle wants to see me to discuss what we learned on Amenos. I should meet her at the courtyard behind Mandrake Manor."
"103224356-0-58409";"Captain Jimila has lost track of her quartermaster, Oblan. They split up to search for the Prowler, but he never returned. I should look for him along the beach."

"103224356-0-58713";"Ember and I need to travel to Marbruk in Greenshade to speak with Jhaka."
"103224356-0-58714";"Ember and I located Jhaka. I should speak with him about his new lead."
"103224356-0-58715";"We found Silverslip, though she is much changed. Still, Silverslip is the only one who saw a strange glyph that may eventually lead us to Song."
"103224356-0-58716";"The letter warning Jhaka and Silverslip to be careful investigating came from a merchant named Izbadd. Ember wants to go to Evermore to speak with him and find out what he knows."
"103224356-0-58717";"Ember spotted Izbadd at the tavern. I should speak with him and figure out what he knows."
"103224356-0-58718";"We found Song and learned the dark secret of her family and the Emerald Eye. Song is free and Ember has accomplished her long held desire to learn the fate of her friends from her days in Skywatch."
"103224356-0-58723";"I should talk to Ember about the information Brisha provided."
"103224356-0-58724";"Brisha said he heard about a Pahmar said to be working at the Gateway Inn in Sadrith Mora. Ember and I need to head there to track down this lead."
"103224356-0-58725";"I don't see a Pahmar in the immediate area. I should ask around the inn about the tip."
"103224356-0-58729";"We need to find the jeweler, Varvisi Uleni, and get a bracelet from her if we are to get any information from the owner of the Gateway Inn."
"103224356-0-58730";"Osithos kept his word, such as it is. He sold Jhaka to bandits, who last he heard, were headed to Pulk. Ember and I need to go there to investigate."
"103224356-0-58731";"We need to explore Pulk and locate Jhaka. One big Pahmar among bandits should't be hard to find."
"103224356-0-58732";"Jhaka is obviously weak and ill. I should talk to him to make sure he is well enough to make it out of this place."
"103224356-0-58733";"Jhaka is determined to be free of the bandits and Pulk and will stick with us as we escort him to safety."
"103224356-0-58734";"I should talk to Ember about the situation before we head into Pulk."
"103224356-0-58735";"Now that we're outside of Pulk, I should speak with Jhaka while Ember heals him."
"103224356-0-58737";"I should enter the Firepot to begin searching for the scoria and for Tarrinore."
"103224356-0-58738";"We got the bracelet, we should return it to Osithos at the inn."
"103224356-0-58739";"It seems like Ember has a plan to get the bracelet the inn owner wants. I should talk to her."
"103224356-0-58740";"Ember wants to turn me into a monkey so I can distract the jeweler. While I do that, Ember will steal the bracelet from her. I need to do this quickly before the spell wears off."
"103224356-0-58742";"I found Tarrinore and collected all the shed scoria, including the large pile that Tarrinore was excited about. I should meet Vinilsare outside the cave."
"103224356-0-58743";"Ember got the bracelet from the jeweler. I should talk to her."
"103224356-0-58751";"Jhaka tracked down a former captain of the mercenary group, Kestrin's Blades. Apparently, he's living in Betnikh now. Ember and I need to go there and question him."
"103224356-0-58752";"We found Guruz. Now it's time to find out what he knows."
"103224356-0-58753";"Ember says she can mix up a concoction that will sober up Guruz quickly. We need to search for a sour algae bloom."
"103224356-0-58754";"I administered a cure for the ailing <<1>> and obtained <<2>>'s release. I should meet them back at the Ancient Anchor Inn."
"103224356-0-58757";"Ember's tonic worked. Guruz is sober enough to talk. I should ask him about the Skywatch job from years back."
"103224356-0-58758";"Guruz says that after the mercenaries kidnapped Ember's friends, they gave Silverslip to a group of vampires dwelling in the Shrine of the Black Maw, in Shadowfen. We need to go there to continue our search."
"103224356-0-58759";"Guruz said that Kestrin's Blades handed a Wood Elf girl over to vampires near Black Maw. Ember and I should go there to search for any sign of her."
"103224356-0-58760";"Ember noticed Silverslip's journal inside the shrine. I should read it to see if there are any clues inside as to her whereabouts."
"103224356-0-58765";"Now that we're outside, I should talk to Silverslip about what I read in her journal."
"103224356-0-58766";"You can search for apples around the festival grounds or trade with other players for them. Grocers in towns also carry apples."
"103224356-0-58770";"Izbadd asked us to track down an estranged uncle from Song's family to see what he knows about her whereabouts and the Emerald Eye. I should discuss this with Ember before deciding what to do next."
"103224356-0-58771";"We need to look for Song's estranged uncle, Azamel, in Sentinel. Izbadd's information says that he was ousted from the Emerald Eye's family business, so he might be willing to provide some information."
"103224356-0-58772";"We found Azamel. Time to see if he'll talk to me about the Emerald Eye and Song."
"103224356-0-58773";"Azamel whispered to us that we should follow him. He might be nervous about being overheard. Ember and I should follow him so we can speak further."
"103224356-0-58774";"Azamel led us to an Outlaws Refuge in Sentinel. I should speak with him and find out what he knows."
"103224356-0-58775";"Azamel gave us a good deal of information about the Emerald Eye and Song. I should discuss these findings with Ember."
"103224356-0-58776";"We should look around the camp. There may be something here that can point us to Song."
"103224356-0-58796";"The journal described that the entrance to where the Emerald Eye is keeping Song will be marked by a tomb door different from the others inside the necropolis. We need to find that tomb and enter it."
"103224356-0-58799";"Ember and I need to destroy the confinement wards erected inside in order to get to Song. I should do this quickly."
"103224356-0-58800";"The Emerald Eye relic is destroyed and Song's father is gone. I should speak with Song and make sure she is unhurt."
"103224356-0-58801";"Song needs a moment to collect her thoughts. I should speak with Ember in the meantime."
"103224356-0-58802";"I found a journal detailing where the Emerald Eye is holding Song. I should discuss this with Ember."
"103224356-0-58805";"A strange magic related to the Emerald Eye relic dragged Song into another room. We need to get in there and save her."
"103224356-0-58814";"I found some clues about the source of the ritual that cursed the pirates. I should discuss what to do next with Ilyes Maul."
"103224356-0-58815";"All that's left is to destroy the deep druid tome that is the source of the commodore's ancient spell. I should go to its altar and burn it."
"103224356-0-58820";"Aurelia sent the letter from the island of Stros M'Kai. If we're going to figure out who stole the signet ring, we should meet up with her at the Screaming Mermaid inn."
"103224356-0-58821";"I should speak to Isobel one more time, to get her final thoughts on our adventure."
"103224356-0-58823";"The commander should be in her offices in the Knight's Wing of the castle. I should find out why she reached out to Isobel."
"103224356-0-58824";"Aurelia has apparently gone off on some kind of quest. The knight commander is concerned for her safety. The commander suggested we start by searching Nilsmon Booklover's bunk in the castle barracks."
"103224356-0-58826";"To find out what this is all about, we have to speak to Knight Commander Jourvel at the Ancient Anchor Inn, in Gonfalon Bay."
"103224356-0-58827";"We found Knight Commander Jourvel at the Ancient Anchor. I should speak to her."
"103224356-0-58828";"Dame Jourvel has a letter she recently received from Aurelia. I should read it."
"103224356-0-58829";"It seems everything has turned out for the best. I should speak to Isobel one more time."
"103224356-0-58830";"Aurelia is upset, in a bad state. I need to chat with her to see what happened."
"103224356-0-58831";"Aurelia struggled with the thief and managed to slice open his pack. We should attempt to follow his trail by looking out for dropped stolen goods."
"103224356-0-58832";"The conman made it to the docks. Perhaps someone in the area knows where Kiv was headed."
"103224356-0-58833";"Kiv Lindres made for the Morrowind port of Seyda Neen, so that's where we're headed too. We should ask around town to see if anyone has seen him."
"103224356-0-58837";"We met one of Kiv's past associates. She told us he left some belongings inside the tavern. They might contain a clue as to where he's gone."
"103224356-0-58838";"Julles Laurdon is at at the Temple of the Divines. We should talk to him."
"103224356-0-58841";"Kiv is in Belkarth, meeting someone named Goldleaf. Hopefully we can corner Kiv and get the ring back from him."
"103224356-0-58842";"Nilsmon might be somewhere on the docks at Gonfalon Bay. We should see if we can find him there."
"103224356-0-58843";"We found Nilsmon! Time to see if he's seen Aurelia recently."
"103224356-0-58844";"According to Nilsmon, Aurelia left Gonfalon Bay with Captain Marso, the merchant captain friend of Isobel's we met on Stros M'Kai. We need to find out where his ship was headed. One of the shipping clerks may know something."
"103224356-0-58845";"We got the seathorn to Halz and he gave us the stolen wine for Elzugoth. Now to find out where Captain Marso's ship was headed."
"103224356-0-58846";"Captain Marso and Aurelia were bound for Northsalt Village, in the northern area of Rivenspire. We should follow after them."
"103224356-0-58847";"We found Captain Marso, who has been injured in a fight with pirates. Aurelia is nowhere to be seen. Let's see what he has to say."
"103224356-0-58848";"Aurelia was snatched as Captain Marso's first mate tried to escort her to safety. The mate said the pirates put Aurelia in a boat and rowed southeast, along the coast. I should trace the coastline to find her."
"103224356-0-58849";"Aurelia is unharmed and excited about the information she's found. I should speak to her."
"103224356-0-58850";"Aurelia has been found, but wants to stay in Rivenspire to continue her investigation. I should see how Isobel wants to go forward."
"103224356-0-58851";"I should speak to Isobel about what we found in Nilsmon's bunk."
"103224356-0-58852";"I should see how Isobel feels about the Commander's request."
"103224356-0-58853";"Her last letter to her mother said that Aurelia was in Fell's Run. Back to Rivenspire we go."
"103224356-0-58854";"I found Aurelia, alive and well, having an urgent conversation with a friend in the Fell's Run Inn. I should speak with her."
"103224356-0-58855";"To free Captain Marso, we must brave the dangers of Obsidian Scar. He should be within the dungeon somewhere, held by brigands."
"103224356-0-58856";"Isobel and I must return to Fell's Run and let Aurelia know we found Marso. The captain should be close behind."
"103224356-0-58857";"Aurelia's mage friend, Ennic, seems very upset. We should find out why."
"103224356-0-58858";"Aurelia was dragged off at knifepoint by Vetitia Marcott, the one who received the funds stolen from Veloise Mercantile. They apparently headed north, toward the Orc's Finger ruins."
"103224356-0-58860";"Aurelia and Marso are safe. I should speak with Isobel about all of this."
"103224356-0-58867";"Balki was hired to find a map fragment. I should search his backpack to see if he acquired it before he died."
"103224356-0-58868";"I should talk to <<1>>."
"103224356-0-58869";"I found <<1>> on the Dufort Shipyards. I should deliver the map fragment and inform him that <<2>> is dead."
"103224356-0-58870";"I got the piece of the map mentioned in Balki's instructions. I should take it to the Dufort Shipyards and let <<1>> know what happened."
"103224356-0-58871";"I should read the note next to Balki's body."
"103224356-0-58872";"Ferone was hired to find a map fragment. I should search her backpack to see if she acquired it before she died."
"103224356-0-58873";"I should talk to <<1>>."
"103224356-0-58874";"I found <<1>> on the Dufort Shipyards. I should deliver the map fragment and inform him <<2>> is dead."
"103224356-0-58875";"I got the piece of the map mentioned in Ferone's instructions. I should take it to the Dufort Shipyards and let <<1>> know what happened."
"103224356-0-58876";"I should read the note next to Ferone's body."
"103224356-0-58877";"According to the instructions I found, <<1>> was looking for a piece of map for <<2>> at the Dufort Shipyards. I should find the map so I can deliver it there."
"103224356-0-58878";"I should talk to <<1>>."
"103224356-0-58879";"I found <<1>> on the Dufort Shipyards. I should deliver the map fragment and inform him <<2>> is dead."
"103224356-0-58880";"I got the piece of the map. I should take it to Dufort Shipyards and let <<1>> know what happened."
"103224356-0-58881";"I should read the note next to Rhadh's body."
"103224356-0-58882";"I was able to dig up a chest at the location the map led me to. I should take it."
"103224356-0-58883";"I found the lost treasure. I should return to  <<1>>."
"103224356-0-58884";"I should take the reassembled map to Shipwreck Shoals and attempt to locate where the Scourge of Sentinel's treasure is hidden."
"103224356-0-58889";"There is a festival for Zenithar, the God of Commerce and Toil, happening in Belkarth. I should talk to Amminus Varo about it."
"103224356-0-58890";"Maybe the historical plaques in Monument Lighthouse will reveal something that will help Stibbons and I lift the islet's curse. I should read them."
"103224356-0-58891";"Now that the worst of this is over, I should talk to Stibbons about my payment."
"103224356-0-58892";"As I left to follow Lady Laurent, the ghost of Janne Emarie flowed into me, but she doesn't seem to mean me any harm. Now that I arrived at the big tree near the center of the islet, I should talk to Lady Laurent."
"103224356-0-58894";"The ancient sea captain mentioned Port Sargo, which Stibbons tells me is the old dock on the eastern shore of All Flags Islet. I should see if there are any clues concerning this curse there."
"103224356-0-58895";"Lady Laurent, speaking as some ancient sea captain, said she needed to keep a rendezvous at the big tree. I should follow Lady Laurent and see what happens."
"103224356-0-58900";"After we examined the historical plaques and determined that the master builder who constructed the All Flags memorial was the ancient sea captain's brother, Tobin Moorcroft, Janne's ghost emerged from me. I should talk to her."
"103224356-0-58901";"Lady Laurent regained her senses enough to suggest we check the historical plaques inside the lighthouse for some clue as to how to break the curse."
"103224356-0-58902";"The ghost of Janne Emarie thinks the curse began at the islet's inn. I should head over to Monument Inn and see what I can learn there."
"103224356-0-58903";"The ghost of Janne Emarie entered the deserted inn. She seems to be caught up in another memory of the past. I should talk to her and see what I can learn."
"103224356-0-58904";"We found Julles Laurdon in Wayrest. Kiv had him fooled as well. I should check in with Isobel to see what she thinks."
"103224356-0-58906";"The ancient sea captain mentioned setting sail from Port Sargo. Maybe the plaque at the old dock contains some information about him or his ship. I should examine it."
"103224356-0-58908";"Lady Laurent arrived, but it appears that the ancient sea captain is back in control of her body. He addressed me as Baron-Admiral Bendu Olo. I should talk to him."
"103224356-0-58912";"Stibbons says the tools needed to add a name to the plaques are buried in the graveyard. I should search for them there."
"103224356-0-58915";"Stibbons says this spot looks familiar. I should search here for Tobin Moorcroft's hammer and chisels."
"103224356-0-58918";"Now that we have the tools, I should go to the Memorial Garden."
"103224356-0-58921";"We finally got the ancient sea captain to reveal his name—Captain Renwic Moorcroft! But his brother Tobin seems to have possessed Stibbons. I should talk to him."
"103224356-0-58923";"Goldleaf was supposed to meet Kiv beneath the Crossroads Tavern in Belkarth. The entrance to the basement is along the side of the building. Finally! We can confront the swindler."
"103224356-0-58924";"Kiv told us the ring was near a twin spire of rock north of Ogondar's Winery. If he's telling the truth, we should find Isobel's family ring there."
"103224356-0-58926";"After quite the adventure, we found Isobel's ring. I should speak to her."
"103224356-0-58930";"I need to place Captain Renwic Moorcroft's name on the memorial plaque to end this curse."
"103224356-0-58931";"I should talk to Stibbons and see if he thinks the curse is over now."
"103224356-0-58932";"We added Captain Renwic's name to the memorial and Lady Laurent seems to be back to her old self. I should talk to her."
"103224356-0-58934";"According to the dock worker, Kiv sailed for Seyda Neen on the island of Vvardenfell. I should speak to Isobel and see what she wants to do now."
"103224356-0-58936";"It seems that Squire Rayan has an idea. I should follow him and see what he has on his mind."
"103224356-0-58944";"Based on his poetry and the rum at his bunk, Isobel thinks we should look for Nilsmon at the Ancient Anchor Inn, Gonfalon Bay."
"103224356-0-58949";"Elzugoth, a shipping clerk, can tell us where Marso's ship was headed, but she wants a favor in return. We need to find some seathorn and bring it to a thief named Halz in exchange for some stolen wine."
"103224356-0-58952";"I need to find Lady Laurent and see if this curse is as bad as Stibbons has claimed. He says she's become a different person. He says she's been possessed by an ancient sea captain and that I'll find her on the southern shore of the islet."
"103224356-0-58953";"We found Lady Laurent. I should talk to her."
"103224356-0-58954";"I arrived at Lady Arabelle's camp. I should speak with her and give her the medallions."
"103224356-0-58961";"Captain Basrush suggested I dress the part of a prisoner to avoid suspicion. I should put on the disguise."
"103224356-0-58962";"We reached the mill. Now I just have to get it turning again."
"103224356-0-58967";"We've found the smithy. We should find the means to complete the weapon inside. Time to head in."
"103224356-0-58968";"We arrived at the blacksmith's shop. I need to assemble the hammer using one of the workbenches."
"103224356-0-58969";"Now that I have the hammer assembled, I need to imbue it with the water we siphoned from the bloodmage's heart."
"103224356-0-58971";"We have the imbued hammer! Now to take it into the tower and confront the bloodmage."
"103224356-0-58973";"We've entered the tower. Squire Rayan and I need to find Dame Madach."
"103224356-0-58975";"Dame Madach has been badly wounded. I should speak with her and check on her condition."
"103224356-0-58984";"Aurelia wants to keep investigating, to figure out what Kiv's scheme here in Rivenspire was about. I should let Isobel know there's been a change in plans."
"103224356-0-59008";"Captain Marso is a little worse for wear, but alive. We need to get him out of here."
"103224356-0-59013";"We made our escape from Obsidian Scar. I should talk to Captain Marso."
"103224356-0-59016";"We found Aurelia. She appears to be unharmed. Time to get her free."
"103224356-0-59023";"We found Captain Marso in a cage within Obsidian Scar. We need to get him out of here."
"103224356-0-59045";"Isobel's idea worked, and the barrier is down. We need to search the wizard's home for the Oldwood Staff, or for the wizard himself."
"103224356-0-59046";"Jakarn told me that Lady Arabelle needs me to help her investigate the Ascendant Order. I should meet her at Mandrake Manor."
"103224356-0-59051";"High King Emeric thinks we might find a clue as to where they're keeping Prince Irnskar somewhere in this camp. I should look around."
"103224356-0-59053";"High King Emeric will give me the signal to attack."
"103224356-0-59054";"I must defeat the Green Serpents at the gate."
"103224356-0-59058";"Lady Arabelle said she will deliver the invitation medallion to High King Emeric. I need to go to Lady Arabelle's camp in Vvardenfell to talk with her afterward."
"103224356-0-59061";"Magister Irin didn't seem very upset about the magic that recently plagued Tor Draioch. Ember will probably be relieved, I should speak with her."
"103224356-0-59066";"I located Quartermaster Oblan, I should speak with him at once."
"103224356-0-59067";"It seems I passed the Trial of Perseverance. Cynric said I can exit the test through the unlocked door."
"103224356-0-59068";"All three of the protection wards around Tor Draioch are restored. I should speak to Ember about what to do next."
"103224356-0-59069";"Ember is worried about the magical motes around Tor Draioch. Apparently, some are becoming malevolent. She's asked me to head to Tor Draioch's tower to search Magister Irin's things for information about the motes themselves."
"103224356-0-59070";"In order to play Tales of Tribute, I need to speak to the Gonfalon game-baron, Master Razhamad. I can find him in the Gonfalon Gaming Hall."
"103224356-0-59071";"I should talk to the local game-baron, Master Razhamad."
"103224356-0-59072";"I should challenge Brahgas to a game of Tribute so I can learn the game's fundamentals. He offered to lend me a deck of cards to play with."
"103224356-0-59073";"I played my first game of Tales of Tribute and learned the basics. I should return to Master Razhamad and inform him of my success."
"103224356-0-59078";"Master Razhamad encouraged me to challenge Brahgas to a game of Tribute so I can learn the basics. I'll find him in the beginners lounge of the Gonfalon Gaming Hall."
"103224356-0-59083";"Now that I'm in the passage, I should head to the Trial of Constitution."
"103224356-0-59086";"I passed the Trial of Constitution and earned the right to proceed. I should exit now."
"103224356-0-59091";"Captain Jimila recommended I find the Sea Elf pirates' stash of kindlepitch."
"103224356-0-59092";"Captain Jimila recommended that I grab a crate of kindlepitch."
"103224356-0-59093";"I located the Prowler in the cove. Now I should speak with Captain Jimila."

"103224356-0-60012";"A journal written by Lord Bacaro and a genealogy of his family's bloodline points to two conclusions: Lord Bacaro is the Ascendant Lord and he believes he's a direct descendant of the Druid King Kasorayn."

"103224356-0-60027";"Druid Fenas determined that an aspect of the curse is that we can only lift it from one of its victims. I need to decide to save either Joslin or Octin while Fenas keeps the ritual energy flowing."

"103224356-0-60040";"The first step in the ritual is to ignite the fire shard. I should do that now."
"103224356-0-60041";"We finished the ritual, but Joslin and Octin still seem to be cursed. I should talk to Druid Fenas and find out what we did wrong."

"103224356-0-61202";"Protus thinks the Painted Eye and Nilphas Drethan are working together. Protus used to be able to control the security measures in Kemel-Ze, but it needs Mnemonic Fragments to regain that function. I should help Protus gather what it needs."

"103224356-0-61251";"Keshargo wasn't in the study to meet us. Mazandi said we should go and look for him."
"103224356-0-61252";"Valinna captured Keshargo and is making him lead her to the Itinerant Staff. He's lying though and convinced her that he hid it in the Spiral Skein. I should go through the rift after them and rescue Keshargo before Valinna realizes his scheme."

"103224356-0-61610";"Dreynis suddenly appeared when Garalo opened a portal in the rotunda. He fled into Garalo's portal. Garalo told me to follow him."
"103224356-0-61611";"I warned Garalo about the prism's corrupting influence. He decided to keep it locked away. After all, Dreynis's notes seem to be more than enough to advance his career."
"103224356-0-61612";"Dreynis warned me of the prism's effects. I need to decide whether to tell Garalo the whole truth, and save him from the prism, or let it corrupt him the way it did Dreynis."
"103224356-0-61615";"It appears that the Hidden Kindred cultist turned the Green Glass Inn into some sort of a base of operations here in the village. I should search for clues about their intentions here."
"103224356-0-61616";"In the Green Glass Inn I found several clues about the Hidden Kindred and their intentions in Alavelis. I should talk to Scruut about what we learned."
"103224356-0-61617";"Scruut and I learned the Hidden Kindred built a gateway to Apocrypha in the glass mine of Alavelis. I should go investigate."
"103224356-0-61618";"I entered the glass mine of Alavelis. I should look for the gateway the villagers were forced to build here."
"103224356-0-61621";"Sharp and I arrived to find Reynila at the mercy of more of the Reformer's mercenaries. We need to help her fight them off."

"103224356-0-61626";"I should talk to Dacia about her decision to work for Sathile again and search for a cure for Nathyn."
"103224356-0-61627";"Scruut activated the gateway and opened a portal to Apocrypha. I should use the portal and see where it leads."
"103224356-0-61628";"Hezehk tells me that he needs to find his mirror first. Apparently, it can help track down the Voidprowlers. I should meet him where the attack occurred, at a set of steps to the south."
"103224356-0-61629";"Hezehk wants me to search for his mirror and any items the Voidprowlers may have when they attacked. I should look around the area for anything out of place."
"103224356-0-61630";"I found Hezehk's mirror on a table, and picked up a scrap of fabric, an empty satchel, and a soggy notebook. I should give them to Hezehk in case he can use them to track the Voidprowlers."
"103224356-0-61631";"I gave Hezehk his mirror and he used it to track the Voidprowlers. They went south to the Obscured Forum. I should join Hezehk there to recover his secret."
"103224356-0-61632";"When we arrived at the entrance to the Obscured Forum, several dead Daedra littered the ground. One is still alive, but severely wounded. I should talk to her to find out what happened."
"103224356-0-61633";"Voidprowler Dys told me that her clan leader went inside the Obscured Forum. He has Hezehk's secret with him. I should enter the enormous library and search for him."
"103224356-0-61634";"I entered the Obscured Forum with Hezehk. I should search the massive library for Voidprowler Zavaal and recover the stolen secret."
"103224356-0-61635";"This facility is far larger than Hezehk expected. I should speak with him before continuing further."
"103224356-0-61636";"Using his magical mirror, Hezehk caught a glimpse of the clan leader inside the Obscured Forum. I should continue to look for him and the missing secret."
"103224356-0-61637";"With the reagents, Hezehk will perform his spell from the Great Hall of Secrets. I should enter the hall now."
"103224356-0-61638";"I found Voidprowler Zavaal's dead body crumpled on the ground. There's a note next to him. I should read it to see if it's Madam Whim's secret."
"103224356-0-61641";"Sharp and I learned that Federo fled to Tinkerer Tobin's Workshop in Eastmarch. We should travel to Eastmarch to see if he's still there."
"103224356-0-61642";"We found Federo living rough in Eastmarch. I should talk to him."
"103224356-0-61643";"Mevei agreed to help us help Federo. I should take the forged identity papers that Mevei made."
"103224356-0-61644";"Sharp and I acquired clothing and forged identity documents for Federo to start a new life away from the Telvanni Peninsula. Federo said he'd meet us in the Outlaws Refuge to make the exchange."
"103224356-0-61645";"Now that we unearthed the cache, we should investigate its contents."
"103224356-0-61646";"Federo's cache gave us a lot of information. I should talk to Sharp about what I learned from reading."
"103224356-0-61647";"Federo's cache of information gave enough information for us to find the location of a secret lab belonging to Sondivel Ulres. Sharp and I should head to the bridge to the Dwarven ruins near Gnisis in Vvardenfell and seek the hidden key."
"103224356-0-61648";"Sharp and I are seeking the key to the hidden lab of Sondivel Ulres, the Reformer. I should talk to Sharp to discuss what comes next."
"103224356-0-61650";"Sharp's tracking spell led us to the hidden key to the Reformer's secret lab. I should take the key."
"103224356-0-61651";"Sharp and I made it inside the secret lab of the Reformer. It seems deserted, but we should seek out any information or useful items that will help us learn more about the Reformer's whereabouts."
"103224356-0-61652";"Sharp is being magically restrained by the Reformer. I should smash the strange metal acting as a conduit and save Sharp."
"103224356-0-61653";"Sharp seems rattled by what just happened in the Reformer's lab. We need to leave the lab and get to safety."
"103224356-0-61654";"I should talk to Sharp about what happened inside the Reformer's lab."
"103224356-0-61655";"I recovered all of the escaped Daedric creatures from across Blackwood. Now I should return to Plokun."
"103224356-0-61658";"Scruut senses that the invaders have headed south. I should follow their trail and see where they're going."
"103224356-0-61659";"The trail led us to a wounded mortal scribe outside a place called the Tranquil Catalog. I should ask him what happened here."
"103224356-0-61660";"Scruut believes Vaermina's servants are searching the Tranquil Catalog for the location of the secret they want to steal from Apocrypha. We need to go in and stop them."
"103224356-0-61665";"The clan leader did not have the missing secret. I should talk to Hezehk to find out what he thinks."
"103224356-0-61666";"Hezehk is going to attempt an old spell to locate the missing secret. I should gather the reagents he asked for to perform this spell."
"103224356-0-61667";"I should speak with Hezehk prior to him performing his finding spell in an attempt to locate his missing secret."
"103224356-0-61668";"While Hezehk performs his finding spell I should go down into the Great Hall and be ready to locate his missing secret."
"103224356-0-61671";"Hezehk has located the missing secret, I should gather it for him."
"103224356-0-61672";"I gathered Hezehk's missing secret. Now I should speak with him."
"103224356-0-61673";"After performing his summoning spell Hezehk is weakened and asked that I take the secret into the intake room."
"103224356-0-61674";"I found Hezehk in the room with the Intake Maw. It told us that we'd receive a boon for knowledge. I should deposit the secret to get Mora's boon."
"103224356-0-61675";"After delivering Madam Whim's secret, the Intake Maw delivered the Boon of Mora. I should collect it for Hezehk."
"103224356-0-61676";"Hezehk left me alone in the Obscured Forum after I recovered the Boon of Mora. I should leave and join him outside to hand over the Boon."
"103224356-0-61677";"Dacia noticed some papers scattered around this room. I should see if any of them can give us more information about what happened in the caverns."
"103224356-0-61679";"Sharp and I were surprised to find Mevei Andros in Windhelm. It seems like she's the document forger we were looking for. I should talk to her about securing a new identity for Federo."
"103224356-0-61681";"Federo needs new clothing to help him start his new life as a courier for the Antiquarian Circle. Sharp and I should search Windhelm for something inexpensive."
"103224356-0-61688";"The portal to the Pool of Inquiry has been unsealed by the invaders. I should go through the portal and follow them."
"103224356-0-61689";"I need to go to three different shrines, each dedicated to a different aspect of Hermaeus Mora, in order to replenish the sacred tears and use the waters of scrying in the Pool of Inquiry."
"103224356-0-61690";"I gathered three sacred tears from the manifestations of Hermaeus Mora. Now I must place them in the pool to access the waters of scrying."
"103224356-0-61691";"I placed the sacred tears of Hermaeus Mora in the pool, opening a portal to the Tranquil Archives. Whatever the invaders seek is on the other side."
"103224356-0-61692";"The Pool of Inquiry led us to a place Scruut calls the Tranquil Archives. We must find and confront the invaders."
"103224356-0-61693";"I found Kynreeve Ryl and Torvesard examining a glyphic in the archives. Torvesard departed, but Kynreeve Ryl stayed behind to face me. I need to defeat him to get to the glyphic"
"103224356-0-61694";"The books archived in the glyphic were mostly erased of the information they once held. I should talk to Scruut and see if she can make sense of what remained."
"103224356-0-61695";"Now that we're finished in the Tranquil Catalog, it's time to leave."
"103224356-0-61713";"Sharp has a tracking spell that should help us find the key to Sondivel's lab. I should follow the tracking critter to find the key."
"103224356-0-61715";"Sharp and I have the key to the Reformer's laboratory. It's time to head inside."
"103224356-0-61728";"Plokun has been reunited with his menagerie. I should speak with him."
"103224356-0-61729";"Plokun needs my help to complete a teleportation spell to send his creatures to Fargrave."
"103224356-0-61733";"Dimik-ei is waiting for Sharp in the swamps north of Alten Corimont in Shadowfen."
"103224356-0-61734";"Sharp and I found Dimik-ei. She said something about recovering Sharp's lost memories. I should talk to her to get more information."
"103224356-0-61735";"Dimik-ei thinks she can use magic to recover Sharp's memories using a sample of tyranite calx. She believes we can find some nearby in Broken Tusk, but I should also see what Sharp thinks about all of this."
"103224356-0-61736";"Sharp wants to speak before we enter Broken Tusk. I should talk to him."
"103224356-0-61737";"We should search inside Broken Tusk for a sample of tyranite calx to bring back to Dimik-ei."
"103224356-0-61738";"I should speak to Dimik-ei before we start the test of returning Sharp's memories to him."
"103224356-0-61739";"Dimik-ei instructed me to touch the tyranite calx. Once I do, I'll enter one of Sharp's forgotten memories."
"103224356-0-61740";"I should wait for Dimik-ei to set up the tyranite calx."
"103224356-0-61760";"Sondivel has taken Dimik-ei captive. He says he will release her and all his slaves if Sharp returns to his possession. I should talk to Sharp about what happened."
"103224356-0-61773";"I must enter Vanton's mind and defeat a nightmare creature named Ansuul the Tormentor before she takes control."
"103224356-0-61774";"I entered the mind of Warlock Vanton and defeated the nightmare creature Ansuul the Tormentor. I should speak with Wizard Twelvane to see if this contains the nightmare."
"103224356-0-61775";"I entered the mind of Warlock Vanton and defeated the nightmare creature Ansuul the Tormentor. I should speak with Wizard Twelvane to see if this contains the nightmare."
"103224356-0-61776";"I  entered the mind of Warlock Vanton and defeated the nightmare creature Ansuul the Tormentor. I should speak with Wizard Twelvane to see if this contains the nightmare."
"103224356-0-61777";"Wizard Twelvane should be the caretaker of this Dreamstone. I just need to give it to her."
"103224356-0-61778";"I should give Wizard Twelvane the Whispering Dreamstone."
"103224356-0-61779";"I should give the Dreamstone to Wizard Twelvane. Hopefully she and the Mages Guild can keep it contained."
"103224356-0-61780";"I should give Wizard Twelvane the Dreamstone. She knows more about it than I do and can hopefully keep what happened to Warlock Vanton from happening again."
"103224356-0-61781";"I should give Wizard Twelvane the Whispering Dreamstone. I don't know if Ansuul the Tormentor is inside it. But, if she is, the Mages Guild is better equipped to keep her contained."
"103224356-0-61782";"Scholar Arlance knows more about what's going on. I should talk to him in Warlock Vanton's Tower."
"103224356-0-61784";"<<1>> created a portal to take me directly to <<2>>."
"103224356-0-61789";"Naryu wants me to provide an update to Master Sulis about our investigation into the identity of the spy."
"103224356-0-61790";"Curate Gadayn and I slipped into the Necropolis through the cellar. We need to reach the chapel and find Abbot Ilvel."
"103224356-0-61791";"The door to the Necropolis chapel is locked. I need to find a way inside."
"103224356-0-61792";"Sharp says Mevei has a lead on how to find the Reformer. We're going to meet her outside the inn in Rawl'kha in Reaper's March."
"103224356-0-61793";"We found Mevei, accompanied by Federo. I should speak to Mevei."
"103224356-0-61795";"Mevei and Federo have tracked down one of Sondivel's slavers to a new hideout in the Ayleid ruins of Senalana. I should relay the plan to Sharp before we head out."
"103224356-0-61796";"One of Sondivel's slavers is hiding out in the ruins of Senalana. Supposedly, the secret entrance to her hideout is marked with a starflower. I should search for a starflower in the ruins of Senalana."
"103224356-0-61797";"We should see what information we can take from Elistrenne Starflower about Sondivel's whereabouts."
"103224356-0-61802";"I arrived at Tel Rendys and Meln materialized. I should talk to him about how to locate the components needed to create the cloak of omission."
"103224356-0-61803";"Meln buried the component we need in caches throughout the tower grounds. He wants me to use his ghost sight to locate the sigils he placed. The caches are buried beneath them."
"103224356-0-61804";"Meln said I can find one of his workbenches near his tower. We can assemble the components we unearthed there."
"103224356-0-61811";"Meln told me to place the components we gathered on the workbench so he can guide me through the creation of the item. He says it will help get me into the Telvanni Masters Conclave."
"103224356-0-61812";"Meln wants to talk to me about the cloak we just created. I should see what else he wants to tell me."
"103224356-0-61816";"Now to put on the cloak of omission and see if it works the way Meln hopes."
"103224356-0-61817";"With Meln's cloak of omission, I'm ready to head to Ald Isra and enter the tower hall to attend the Telvanni Conclave of Masters."
"103224356-0-61818";"Before I can enter the conclave hall, I need to present myself to the sentry and invoke the statute that Meln suggested."

"103224356-0-61821";"Meln thinks he can help us get past the magister's ward. I should follow his instructions so we can warn the masters."

"103224356-0-61826";"Magister Gothren refuses to take the threat posed by Master Shelreni seriously. I need to find out where they're holding Shelreni and reach her before something terrible occurs."
"103224356-0-61827";"We found the room where they were holding Master Shelreni, but it's empty. There's a vial on the table that Meln wants me to examine."
"103224356-0-61828";"Master Shelreni used some sort of dream potion to take control of Master Marena and headed for the conclave. I need to go to the masters private hall to the north and try to stop whatever she's planning."
"103224356-0-61830";"Meln believes we can get through the warded door to stop Magister Shelreni. I should follow his instructions."
"103224356-0-61831";"Master Shelreni unleashed a wave of power and knocked me out. I came to and Magister Gothren wants to talk to me. I should speak with him and learn what happened after I blacked out."
"103224356-0-61832";"Master Shelreni took Master Marena captive and escaped through this portal. I should use it to follow after them."
"103224356-0-61833";"I entered the portal and followed Master Shelreni to a cavern of some sort. I should look around and figure out where I am."
"103224356-0-61835";"A chamber in the cavern ruins might hold a clue as to where Master Shelreni has gone. I should look around."
"103224356-0-61836";"I need to find and retrieve kwama eggs from the Anchre Egg Mine."

"103224356-0-61864";"I reached the restored statue. Shelreni, Blightcrown, and Torvesard have started the rite. I need to stop them and free Master Marena."
"103224356-0-61865";"Meln wants me to close and take his Black Book. That should end the last remnants of Shelreni's rite."
"103224356-0-61866";"I recovered the Black Book but Master Shelreni and Blightcrown aren't finished yet. I should wait and see how they react to the situation."
"103224356-0-61867";"We saved Master Marena but Blightcrown killed Master Shelreni to complete the sacrifice. Now Vaermina inhabits her body and has access to Apocrypha and the location they've been searching for. I should return to Necrom and inform Leramil."
"103224356-0-61875";"Sondivel Ulres, the Reformer, has a new hideout inside the Forgotten Crypts in Deshaan. I should head there with Sharp so we can find Sondivel and rescue Dimik-ei."
"103224356-0-61876";"Sharp has cast a tracking spell to help us locate the secret entrance to Sondivel's lair. I should follow the torchbug he summoned to lead us to the secret entrance."
"103224356-0-61877";"Sharp and I have found the entrance to Sondivel's lair. It's time to go inside and confront Sondivel."

"103224356-0-61879";"Sondivel Ulres has nowhere to run. I should defeat him with Sharp's help."
"103224356-0-61880";"Sondivel Ulres is dead. Sharp has asked me to burn his research notes, destroy the tyranite calx, and help free the remaining slaves kept captive here."
"103224356-0-61882";"Sharp and I have destroyed Sondivel Ulres' slaving operation. It's time to leave this place and meet Dimik-ei in Narsis."
"103224356-0-61883";"We finally put an end to the Reformer, Sondivel Ulres, and the experiments he carried out on his slaves. Sharp wants to speak to me. I should hear what he has to say."
"103224356-0-61893";"To continue the experiment, Azandar wants us to travel to his sanctum sanctorum. It's apparently in the center of town at Skywatch, in Auridon."
"103224356-0-61894";"We made it to his sanctum. Time to talk to Azandar about what his plan is."
"103224356-0-61896";"With the bobbin attached, now we need to complete a scrying ritual and seek out some more of his frayed fates."
"103224356-0-61897";"I helped Azandar to form the arcane bobbin. I should speak to him to see about adding the bobbin to the Fateweaver Key."
"103224356-0-61899";"The scrying ritual indicates frayed fates have appeared in Kozanset in the Alik'r Desert, Azandar's home town. I should head into the desert to see if we can find them."
"103224356-0-61900";"With Azandar at my side, I need to search the tiny town of Kozanset to find his frayed fates and sew them up with the help of the Fateweaver Key and the arcane bobbin."
"103224356-0-61901";"Azandar consulted the Fateweaver Key and believes there's still at least one more frayed fate near Kozanset. He thinks we should head north out of the settlement towards a set of old ruins."
"103224356-0-61902";"Azandar and I once again witnessed that strange frayed fate we saw back at Fathoms Drift. It ran off toward the Lost City of Na-Totambu. We should search for the frayed fate within."
"103224356-0-61903";"I should search the Lost City of Na-Totambu to find Azandar's dangerous frayed fate."
"103224356-0-61906";"I dealt with the frayed fate in the Lost City of Na-Totambu. I should leave with Azandar."
"103224356-0-61907";"I should talk to Azandar about what occurred in the Lost City of Na-Totambu."
"103224356-0-61912";"Azandar wants to modify the fateweaver key by creating what he's calling an arcane bobbin. I can do so using a stencil in which he's already inlaid a spell. I need to find the stencil, first."
"103224356-0-61913";"Azandar asked that I imbue the arcane stencil with magicka. I can do that at the magicka font within the sanctum."
"103224356-0-61914";"Azandar said I need to gesture at his flesh atronach Gubbins with the stencil in order to create the bobbin or spool."
"103224356-0-61915";"The stencil has downed Gubbins, but Azandar has asked me to rummage around in the goop it drew forth. The bobbin should be in there, somewhere."
"103224356-0-61921";"Sharp wants to speak with me before we proceed. I should hear what he has to say."
"103224356-0-61922";"Sharp is going to use a tracking spell that will help us find the secret entrance to Sondivel's lair using tyranite calx. I need to set a fragment of the metal down in Sharp's ritual circle so he can proceed."
"103224356-0-61936";"I discovered the frayed fate that Azandar and I met in Apocrypha, draining energy from another one of Azandar's fates. Perhaps the Fateweaver Key can stop it."
"103224356-0-61937";"Someone named Torvesard fled with part of the Fulcrum Obscura and Blightcrown left behind a diseased monster. I need to destroy the foul creature."
"103224356-0-61938";"I should investigate the tomb and see what Torvesard and Blightcrown left behind."
"103224356-0-61939";"Azandar believes a Daedric creature will know where to find his former associate. To summon the Daedra he needs a tome in the eastern part of Cipher's Midden. I should meet him there."
"103224356-0-61940";"I should speak to Azandar about how he intends to find one book in these stacks."
"103224356-0-61941";"Azandar said he'll cast a spell that should find the tome he's looking for. I need to stay close to the old arcanist."
"103224356-0-61942";"We acquired the book, no thanks to that tomeshell. Time to talk to Azandar about the contents of the book."
"103224356-0-61944";"I gathered the Seeker talon and the expunged tomedust. Time to meet up with Azandar at the ritual altar he mentioned."
"103224356-0-61945";"Azandar managed to banish another one of those frayed fates as I approached. Time to find out what we need to do in order to talk to this Tem."
"103224356-0-61946";"First need to find the tomedust I acquired from the Cipher's Midden expungatory."
"103224356-0-61948";"Tem told us that Martina Abor has a lab of some kind at the Underweave. Azandar wants me to meet him there."
"103224356-0-61949";"We need to find the Heart of the Underweave, where the entrance to Martina's sanctum can be found."
"103224356-0-61950";"We made it into Martina's sanctum. I should search the room for clues as to what happened here."
"103224356-0-61953";"I defeated Vro-Kuul-Sha the Deepreaver and recovered the personal effects that were left behind. I should claim my reward from Ordinator Nelyn"
"103224356-0-61954";"I need to journey into Apocrypha, defeat Vro-Kuul-Sha the Deepreaver, and recover the personal effects of warriors Vro-Kuul-Sha has defeated."
"103224356-0-61957";"I defeated the Walking Nightmare and found the researcher's lost notes. I should return to Ordinator Nelyn and claim my reward."
"103224356-0-61958";"I need to find and confront this Walking Nightmare and recover its victim's research notes."
"103224356-0-61961";"I defeated Valkynaz Dek and saved several captives. I should return to Ordinator Nelyn to claim my reward."
"103224356-0-61962";"I need to go to Apocrypha, defeat Valkynaz Dek, and free his captives."
"103224356-0-61965";"I survived my encounter with the Prime Cataloger and collected several molts from the tomeshells that follow it. I should talk to Ordinator Nelyn and get paid for my efforts."
"103224356-0-61966";"I need to find the Prime Cataloger in Apocrypha and retrieve the molted husks from several of its tomeshell parasites."
"103224356-0-61969";"I defeated Runemaster Xiomara and gathered the arcane residue. I should return to Necrom and collect my reward from Ordinator Nelyn."
"103224356-0-61970";"I should go to the last known location of Xiomara in Apocrypha. I can also collect arcane residue from his victims."
"103224356-0-61973";"I defeated Corlys the Chainmaker and placed mystic trackers on his caravans. I should return to Ordinator Nelyn for my reward."
"103224356-0-61974";"I need to visit the encampment of Corlys the Chainmaker, defeat him, and place mystic trackers on his caravans."
"103224356-0-61985";"Azandar believes our first step should be to scry for more frayed fates. That means a return trip to his Skywatch sanctum, in Auridon."
"103224356-0-61986";"Azandar has asked me to assist him in performing the scrying ritual. I need to light the beacons."
"103224356-0-61987";"We should discuss the frayed fates we located."
"103224356-0-61988";"The first frayed fate we located was near Ebonheart in Stonefalls. Azandar suggested we head to the city to start looking."
"103224356-0-61989";"Our first frayed fate of the day lies somewhere near the city of Ebonheart. I should follow the tracking magic of the Fateweaver Key to find it."
"103224356-0-61990";"The frayed fate near Vivec's Antlers has been drained of energy. I should talk to Azandar about this."
"103224356-0-61991";"Azandar seems rattled, but wants to travel to the site of the other frayed fate we located. It's near the ruins of Ilayas in Malabal Tor."
"103224356-0-61992";"I should search Ilayas with Azandar to locate the frayed fate in the area."
"103224356-0-61993";"Azandar used runic magic to open a portal to the location of his adversary. We should follow to see where it leads."
"103224356-0-61994";"Azandar believes the adversary is inside Nchuleftingth, in what he calls the Ametric Interval Chamber. I should pursue the adversary."
"103224356-0-61995";"With Azandar, we need to traverse Nchuleftingth to reach the Ametric Interval Chamber."
"103224356-0-61996";"I found the chamber, where the adversary is draining a pair of frayed fates! I need to dispel the frayed fates before the adversary can drain them completely."
"103224356-0-61997";"The adversary left Nchuleftingth, threatening to harm Azandar after amassing more power. Azandar wants to leave Nchuleftingth and speak outside."
"103224356-0-61998";"I should speak to Azandar about what occurred in Nchuleftingth."
"103224356-0-62015";"To find the fates frayed from Azandar's fateline, we have to try Martina's scrying technique. The arcanist asked that I meet him at his chambers at Cipher's Midden."
"103224356-0-62016";"We found Martina's research, even if it wasn't the way Azandar wanted. I should talk to him about what we need to do next."
"103224356-0-62019";"We found the frayed fate identified by the scrying ritual. We should observe it."
"103224356-0-62023";"I should talk to Azandar about the unexpected appearance of this adversary."
"103224356-0-62028";"Azandar told me the Fateweaver Key should reveal threads which lead to the frayed fate we seek. I just need to follow them through the Drift to find our way."
"103224356-0-62030";"Azandar is fascinated and somewhat unnerved by the appearance of this adversarial fate. He wants to meet back in Cipher's Midden, giving him time to collect his thoughts."
"103224356-0-62033";"We located the fraying fate in Ilayas."
"103224356-0-62036";"We stepped from the portal to find ourselves on the island of Vvardenfell, outside the Dwemer ruin of Nchuleftingth. I should talk to him about what this means."
"103224356-0-62047";"Azandar thinks anchor objects from his past will allow him to destroy the adversary. A mystic tome at Quires Wind, in Apocrypha, should be able to tell us what we need to procure."
"103224356-0-62048";"I should search Quires Wind for the magic tome, which Azandar calls the Unraveling Palimpsest."
"103224356-0-62049";"I acquired the Palimpsest. I should talk to Azandar about how we can use it to deal with the adversary."
"103224356-0-62050";"This is it. Azandar believes we can destroy the adversary using items from his past. We need to find a bloodstone in Balmora, a sacred text from the observatory near Belkarth, and a research rebuttal from the library at Shad Astula."
"103224356-0-62051";"Azandar and I found his sanctum sealed by the adversary. I need to talk to him about what to do next."
"103224356-0-62052";"We created the runeform needed to destroy the adversary. We still need to find him, so Azandar wants us to return to his sanctum sanctorum to scry for the adversary's location."
"103224356-0-62053";"The adversary has taken control of Azandar's sanctum and is attempting to use its resources to take Azandar's place. We need to go to Entila's Folly. Within is a side passage we can use to enter the sanctum sanctorum."
"103224356-0-62054";"Within Entila's Folly a passageway will allow us to enter the sanctum sanctorum. We need to find the entrance."
"103224356-0-62055";"We need to enter the passageway, which will allow us to reach the sanctum sanctorum and sidestep the magical defenses the adversary has put in place."
"103224356-0-62056";"We need to use the anchor items to construct some kind of runeform. But Azandar wants to consult with the Daedra Tem in order to do it. To talk to Tem, we need to reach the ritual circle below the Mages Guild in Riften."
"103224356-0-62057";"Finally, we're face to face with the adversary and we have the tools we need to destroy him. Time to end this."
"103224356-0-62058";"With the Fateweaver Key burned out, Azandar wants me to throw it from the cliff's edge to ensure he's never tempted to restore this powerful relic."
"103224356-0-62059";"Now that the Fateweaver Key is destroyed, I should talk to Azandar."
"103224356-0-62076";"Morian said we'd need sleep potions from the gazebo nearby to get the bristleback lords to sleep. If we don't do this, he says they won't let us see Cipher Frielvi."
"103224356-0-62079";"I found the gazebo Morian mentioned. I should gather the sleep potions and take them to the skyway."
"103224356-0-62080";"Morian mentioned that animals he called bristleback lords stand between us and Cipher Frielvi. He wanted me to drop the potions on them to put them to sleep."
"103224356-0-62083";"To find out where Vaermina is headed, we need to communicate with Master Shelreni's spirit. I should talk to Meln and see if he can help us with that."
"103224356-0-62084";"I need to go to Tel Baro so Meln can help us locate the spirit of Master Shelreni. Curate Gadayn will meet us there."
"103224356-0-62085";"The bristlebacks are asleep and Morian seems excited. He wants to talk. I should go make sure there's nothing else to worry about."
"103224356-0-62086";"Tel Baro is locked tight, but Meln is confident Master Shelreni has other ways to get into the tower. I need to look around for another way to get inside."
"103224356-0-62087";"We found another entrance into the tower and Meln was able to circumvent the protective ward. I should head inside."
"103224356-0-62092";"After learning all I could from the Ald Isra servants and at the House Dres camp to the south, Naryu wants me to return to Tel Huulen and update Master Sulis about our investigation."
"103224356-0-62093";"Morian believes we can find Cipher Frielvi in her study. I should escort Morian there."
"103224356-0-62094";"The door to Cipher Frielvi's study is buried in rubble. I'm going to need to clear this out before I can get past. Morian said something about needing a spider to do it."
"103224356-0-62097";"Morian's pointing at the book inside the firepot spider enclosure. He says the spiders have all the answers, what if he's right? The only way to find out is to read the note."
"103224356-0-62098";"Firepots are incredibly volatile. I should remove one from the firepot spider."
"103224356-0-62099";"This firepot contains enough power to obliterate the rubble keeping us from finding Frielvi. I should set it down carefully near the rubble."
"103224356-0-62100";"The firepot is set next to the rubble blocking our way. The only thing left to do is ignite it."
"103224356-0-62105";"Both Meln and Gadayn sense a presence in Master Shelreni's study. I should see if I can make contact with her spirit."
"103224356-0-62106";"The spirit of Master Shelreni manifested and Gadayn calmed her. I should attempt to talk to her and see if she can tell us where Vaermina took her body."
"103224356-0-62107";"Master Shelreni said Vaermina took her body into the Infinite Panopticon. I need to return to Necrom and let Leramil know about this."
"103224356-0-62111";"Morian said we'd need a boom to clear the rubble and he was right. The firepot obliterated the debris in our path. I hope Cipher Frielvi's in her study like Morian says she will be."
"103224356-0-62114";"Cipher Frielvi is injured on the floor. She looks pretty bad. I should talk to her and see what happened."
"103224356-0-62115";"I should tell Leramil what we learned from the spirit of Master Shelreni."
"103224356-0-62116";"We know Vaermina seeks something in the Infinite Panopticon. I should return to the entrance we found earlier and see if we can locate it again."
"103224356-0-62117";"Leramil opened a way into the Infinite Panopticon. Now we should enter and look for Vaermina and her allies."
"103224356-0-62118";"I need to search the Infinite Panopticon for Vaermina and her allies."
"103224356-0-62119";"I should talk to Scruut before we enter the Eye of Mora."
"103224356-0-62120";"Scruut insists that we ignore Blightcrown and do what we came to do—destroy Master Shelreni's mortal body and expose Vaermina. She believes that may help restore her connection to Hermaeus Mora so the Prince can help us."
"103224356-0-62121";"We entered the Eye of Mora. I should look around and try to find Vaermina. She must be somewhere in this memory."
"103224356-0-62122";"Scruut thinks that this memory has been hidden inside a dream. I should talk to her about what that means."
"103224356-0-62123";"Vaermina has hidden the true memory behind an illusory dream. I need to use Meln's ghost sight to spot flaws in the illusion and identify them for Scruut so she can break through them and reveal the true memory."
"103224356-0-62125";"Hermaeus Mora broke into the memory, causing Vaermina to flee. I should listen to what he has to say."
"103224356-0-62126";"Hermaeus Mora wants me to follow Vaermina into the core of Apocrypha, a place he called the Mythos. I should follow her."
"103224356-0-62127";"I followed Vaermina into a place Hermaeus Mora called the Mythos. He wants me to stop the Prince of Dreams from obtaining three glyphics he used to hide the secret. I should look around."
"103224356-0-62130";"I heard Vaermina nearby. I need to forge ahead and find her."
"103224356-0-62131";"Vaermina and Torvesard are up ahead, trying to open a locked door. I need to stop them."
"103224356-0-62132";"Vaermina sent a corrupted champion to delay me. I need to defeat it quickly."
"103224356-0-62134";"Hermaeus Mora arrived and drove Vaermina and Torvesard away. He wants to speak to me."
"103224356-0-62135";"I observed the contents of the glyphic. Hermaeus Mora wants to talk to me again."
"103224356-0-62136";"Cipher Frielvi told me how to help Morian escape. I should talk to him so he knows what to do."
"103224356-0-62137";"The barrier keeping Morian in the gallery is weaker in the Forbidden Exhibit. Morian said it wasn't too far."
"103224356-0-62138";"We're in the Forbidden Exhibits. The barrier keeping Morian here should be weak somewhere, I just need to figure out how we can use that to help Morian escape."
"103224356-0-62139";"Seekers have a ward surrounding a portal out of the gallery. I should ask Morian how we're supposed to get to the portal now."
"103224356-0-62140";"Morian wants to unleash the Known Thing on the Seekers and use that to open the way to the portal. Known Things are incredibly dangerous and could cause us a lot of mental harm. I should be cautious when I do this."
"103224356-0-62143";"I don't remember what happened after I opened the Known Thing, but Morian's behaving even more strangely. The portal is undefended though, we should go through it before the Seekers recover."
"103224356-0-62160";"Hermaeus Mora offered to submit himself to our agreement with a contract. He summoned strange glyphics with the power to bind him to his word."
"103224356-0-62162";"Hermaeus Mora offered to submit himself to our agreement with a contract. He summoned strange glyphics with the power to bind him to his word."
"103224356-0-62164";"Hermaeus Mora offered to submit himself to our agreement with a contract. He summoned strange glyphics with the power to bind him to his word."
"103224356-0-62175";"I completed the three tasks Leramil appointed to me on behalf of Hermaeus Mora. I should speak to her about what's next."
"103224356-0-62185";"I should speak with High Ordinator Boryn in the city of Necrom to get more details."
"103224356-0-62187";"I found Naryu inside Tel Huulen. I should follow up with her to complete the writ."
"103224356-0-62188";"I should talk to Naryu and see how she feels about the resolution of the writ."
"103224356-0-62189";"I found the entrance into Kemel-Ze. I should look around and see if I can find Nilphas Drethan."
"103224356-0-62190";"The conflicting magic in the chamber has splintered Leramil's portal spell and deposited us in a different layer of reality. I need to find her scattered portals and follow them back to the Eye of Mora."
"103224356-0-62191";"I have all the major Mnemonic Fragments Protus told me it needed. We should return to the place where I found Protus to finish Protus's repairs."
"103224356-0-62193";"I should find Solni Nrayn in Necrom and deliver her parcel."
"103224356-0-62194";"I have Meln the Mouthless's soul gem. I should leave Tel Baro."
"103224356-0-62196";"My first task is to find Leramil the Wise. She waits for me in the city of Necrom, on the Telvanni Peninsula."
"103224356-0-62197";"I found Leramil the Wise in Necrom. I should talk to her about why I was summoned here."
"103224356-0-62200";"Dusksaber Uleni gave me a strange lens she found near the sealed door. Maybe it will help me determine a way to dispel the ward that seals the door."
"103224356-0-62201";"Leramil thinks we can find out more about the relic, the rite, and the dream at Cipher's Midden in Apocrypha. She asked me to meet her there."
"103224356-0-62202";"I arrived at Cipher's Midden. I should speak to Leramil."
"103224356-0-62205";"Master Shelreni appeared and got away with both Meln's Black Book and Meln himself. I should consult with Leramil about what we should do next."
"103224356-0-62206";"Leramil thinks we need more information. She asked me to search the sanctum of Tel Rendys."
"103224356-0-62211";"Scruut appeared as I finished searching the stacks. I should speak to her."
"103224356-0-62217";"The tomeshell dove into another pile of books, but seems to have shed the book it was using. I should grab it for Azandar."
"103224356-0-62223";"I should meet Leramil the Wise in Cipher's Midden to discuss our next course of action."
"103224356-0-62224";"While Leramil attempts to locate Vaermina and Torvesard, she tasked me with tracking down Blightcrown and finding out how he's spreading the corruption. I should start by investigating Cipher's Midden."
"103224356-0-62231";"The corruption has definitely taken hold in Cipher's Midden. Hopefully by destroying the censer, things here will improve. I should return to Leramil's study and tell them what I found."
"103224356-0-62232";"Leramil and Scruut seem to be adversely affected by the corruption spreading throughout Apocrypha. While Gadayn tries to help Leramil, I should check on Scruut."
"103224356-0-62233";"Torvesard appeared and offered a way to stop the corruption spreading throughout Apocrypha. I should talk to him and hear what he has to say."
"103224356-0-62234";"Torvesard revealed that Blightcrown has entered the Mythos, the very core of Apocrypha. I need to meet him and Leramil at the location he marked on my map so we can find a way into the core of Apocrypha."
"103224356-0-62235";"I arrived at the location and Leramil needs my help with a ritual to open a path into the Mythos. I should do as she directs me."
"103224356-0-62242";"The way to the Mythos is open. I should enter it and look for Blightcrown."
"103224356-0-62243";"I entered the Mythos. Now to look around and try to find Blightcrown, Vaermina, or the Hidden Kindred."
"103224356-0-62244";"Blightcrown has driven huge manufactories into the core of Apocrypha. These giant versions of his censers of corruption are spreading the debilitating plague throughout the realm. I need to disable the eastern manufactory by destroying its crystal."
"103224356-0-62245";"I disabled two of the corruption manufactories, but Meln senses a third one somewhere up ahead. I need to find it and disable it as well."
"103224356-0-62246";"Blightcrown stands before me. Time to end his threat once and for all."
"103224356-0-62247";"Leramil and Scruut arrived and opened a portal. I need to enter it to reach Vaermina, who's still inside the body of Master Shelreni and seeking the next glyphic."
"103224356-0-62248";"Vaermina should be nearby, wearing the body of Master Shelreni. I need to find her and destroy the mortal shell she wears."
"103224356-0-62249";"Vaermina, the Prince of Dreams and Nightmares has possessed the body of Master Shelreni. I need to destroy the body of Master Shelreni to expose Vaermina and defeat her."
"103224356-0-62250";"Torvesard acquired the second glyphic before I could stop him. I should leave the Mythos and consult with Hermaeus Mora."
"103224356-0-62251";"I emerged from the Mythos and Hermaeus Mora wants to talk to me about what happened with Vaermina and Torvesard. I should see what he has to say."
"103224356-0-62252";"I entered the Eye of Mora and seem to be in a memory of Hermaeus Mora. The Dremora, Torvesard, is here. He wants to talk to me. I should see what he has to say."
"103224356-0-62253";"The book Azandar sought has been claimed by a tomeshell. I need to chase after it if I'm going to get it for him."
"103224356-0-62255";"I returned to Leramil's study in Cipher's Midden. Now I should talk to Leramil."
"103224356-0-62261";"Balver says that I will find the bull netch musk gland near Kemel-Ze, fungal blooms from a shroom beetle around Tel Dreloth, and a plant called the volcanic stinkhorn east of Sailenmora."
"103224356-0-62262";"I gathered the ingredients. I should deliver them to Retainer Balver in Ald Isra."
"103224356-0-62263";"Balver asked me to deliver the tincture personally to Oathman Llaro."
"103224356-0-62264";"The tincture was poison, of course. I warned Oathman Llaro not to drink it. He said he would deal with Retainer Balver appropriately."
"103224356-0-62265";"I found a chamber in the Alavelis glass mine that contains an arched gateway. I should look around to see if the Hidden Kindred left any clues behind."
"103224356-0-62266";"We found the instructions to activate the gateway to Apocrypha. I should talk to Scruut and see if she can cast the invocation."
"103224356-0-62272";"Next I need to present the Seeker talon into the ritual mix."
"103224356-0-62273";"Finally, I should pour out the black ichor Azandar procured to completed the summoning ritual."
"103224356-0-62275";"Thanks to the tome we know we need a Seeker talon and expunged tomedust to summon Tem. Azandar's marked my map. I should be able to find a Seeker talon in a nearby plant, and the tomedust at the Cipher's Midden expungatory."
"103224356-0-62283";"I believe Tyss has made her decision to withhold the truth of the pact from the other Remnants. I should talk to her about my reward."
"103224356-0-62293";"I followed Meln's instructions and the components turned into a glowing cloak. I should take it."
"103224356-0-62309";"We banished Vaermina from Apocrypha. Now Hermaeus Mora wants me to enter the vault and make sure the second glyphic is secure."
"103224356-0-62318";"I extracted Gadayn from his conversation with Mouth Elar. Now I should follow Gadayn to a place where we can speak freely."

"103224356-0-63316";"The imposter Uriel is accusing <<1>> of killing <<2>>. I should question <<3>> and see if her story has changed."
"103224356-0-63317";"<<1>> is certain <<2>> could not have brought the tea that day. She accused <<3>> of poisoning the tea, and murdering <<2>> to cover up the crime. I need to speak to <<3>>."
"103224356-0-63318";"<<1>> reveals that Pelena finished brewing the tea for <<2>> that day, countering <<3>>'s claim that she was not there that morning. I should investigate the scene where they met for tea."

"103224356-0-63367";"Fennorian suggested we split up and mingle with the guests at the pre-auction party. I should question the guests without arousing too much suspicion."
"103224356-0-63368";"I talked to several guests at the event. One of them knows Fennorian. I need to let him know before the auction starts."
"103224356-0-63369";"Fennorian advised me to enter the manor and search Lord Gallio Valente's office while he has a discussion with Lady Ursilia Valente."
"103224356-0-63370";"Torvesard's trail led us to shrines dedicated to the Daedric Princes Azura, Boethiah, and Mephala. He appears to be searching for ancient relics. I should confer with Leramil about our next move."
"103224356-0-63371";"Leramil believes that we'll need to consult with a Dark Elf scholar to figure out what exactly Torvesard is looking for. She instructed me to meet her in Vvardenfell at the Shrine of Azura."
"103224356-0-63372";"We met the Dark Elf Gadayn in Vvardenfell. I should speak with him about our mission to find and stop Torvesard."
"103224356-0-63373";"Curate Gadayn was unfamiliar with any relics Torvesard might be seeking, but he suggested visiting the monks at the monastery of Holamayan."
"103224356-0-63374";"Abbot Andor met us at the entrance to Holamayan Monastery. I should see if he knows anything that could help us locate Torvesard."
"103224356-0-63375";"Abbot Andor suggested that the answers we seek may be hidden in the library of Holamayan Monastery."
"103224356-0-63376";"The strange relic Leramil gave me recognizes the presence of a memory associated with the Forgotten Prince. I should use the Echonir to see what it reveals."

"103224356-0-63378";"The book we found in the library of Holamayan indicates that a long-lost shrine of Hermaeus Mora may be what we're looking for. I should consult with Leramil and Gadayn about our next step."
"103224356-0-63379";"Neither Leramil nor Gadayn knows where this lost shrine is hidden. Perhaps one of the monks here at Holamayan can point us in the right direction."
"103224356-0-63380";"We learned the lost Shrine of Inevitable Secrets lies near the ruins of Anudnabia. Now we just need to find the place."
"103224356-0-63381";"The Echonir revealed the existence of another memory in this area. We should use the relic to see what the memory contains."
"103224356-0-63382";"It looks like the lost shrine lies beneath the waters of the Inner Sea. I should speak with Leramil."
"103224356-0-63383";"Leramil assures me she has a spell that can help us reach the Shrine of Inevitable Secrets, even though it sank into the sea long ago."
"103224356-0-63384";"I found Lord Gallio Valente's office. I should search around for evidence concerning the true purpose of this auction."
"103224356-0-63386";"Fennorian found me in Lord Valente's office. I should talk to him and tell him what I uncovered."
"103224356-0-63387";"Fennorian wants to head downstairs to find the alchemical laboratory in the winery. He wants to make sure this is the last batch of Vesper Valente."

"103224356-0-63389";"Fennorian and I discovered some of the servants used in Lord Gallio Valente's experiments. I should speak to Fennorian about what we can do for them."
"103224356-0-63390";"Fennorian believes he can brew a counteragent to reverse the effects of Gallio's experiments. I need to find waxflower petals, Imperial oak tannins, and grape pulp for him in the winery."
"103224356-0-63391";"I found the ingredients Fennorian asked for. I should return to him so he can craft the alchemical counteragent to save the captives we found."
"103224356-0-63392";"The counteragent is currently distilling. I need to wait for Fennorian to finish preparing it for use on the victims of Lord Gallio Valente."
"103224356-0-63393";"Fennorian made a counteragent to help the victims of Lord Gallio Valente's experiments. I should pour it on on them."
"103224356-0-63394";"Fennorian's alchemical counteragent worked. I should speak to one of the victims to learn more about what happened to them."
"103224356-0-63395";"The alchemical laboratory should be in the caverns through the doors to the south of where we helped the caged victims. I should head in and find the laboratory."
"103224356-0-63396";"To destroy the laboratory, Fennorian suggests I turn the flame valves under the fermentation vats all the way up. That will increase the pressure and cause them to explode."
"103224356-0-63397";"Fennorian and I destroyed Lord Gallio Valente's laboratory and the mushroom crop responsible for cultivating the grapes used to create Vesper Valente wine. We should leave the winery and meet outside."
"103224356-0-63398";"Thanks to Leramil's magic, we can walk along the bottom of the sea! Now we just need to make our way to the sunken shrine."
"103224356-0-63399";"We located Hermaeus Mora's sunken shrine. Now we should use the portal and make our way inside."
"103224356-0-63400";"The ancient shrines Torvesard visited across Tamriel somehow led him to this demiplane connected to Hermaeus Mora's lost shrine. He must be here somewhere. I need to find him."
"103224356-0-63401";"With the relic he recovered from Boethiah's shrine, Torvesard was able to open a portal to the heart of Hermaeus Mora's domain. We have to follow him!"
"103224356-0-63402";"Torvesard found his way to the Mythos, the very heart of Hermaeus Mora's realm. We need to stop him before he reaches the glyphic containing the secret of the Forgotten Prince's fate."
"103224356-0-63403";"Torvesard found the last glyphic that holds the secret of Ithelia's fate. He seems to have triggered a powerful memory."
"103224356-0-63404";"I defeated the glass mantikora, but Torvesard made good use of my delay. I need to find him before he opens the Glyphic of Shattered Reflections."
"103224356-0-63405";"A strange Daedra of glass appeared to confront us! We must defeat it if we have any hope of stopping Torvesard from reaching the glyphic he seeks."
"103224356-0-63406";"Torvesard learned that Ithelia, the Forgotten Prince, is imprisoned in the Mythos. He found a portal to the site of her prison. I should follow."
"103224356-0-63407";"The prison of the Forgotten Prince is empty! Somehow Ithelia has already escaped, but Torvesard is still here. Perhaps he can explain what happened here."
"103224356-0-63408";"I should speak with Leramil about what happened here."
"103224356-0-63409";"Leramil suggests regrouping in Grahtwood. I should meet her there."
"103224356-0-63410";"Now that I'm inside Varen's Watch, I need to search the rubble piles for any Reachfolk trinkets I can find."

"103224356-0-63421";"The note found on Uriel's imposter was written by Chef Edric and reveals Pelena's involvement in Uriel's death. Now that Betu has recovered Mizzik suggests we follow him in the hopes that he can track Pelena."
"103224356-0-63422";"I tracked <<1>> into the tunnels below the manor. I should apprehend her before she escapes."
"103224356-0-63423";"I  stopped  <<1>> from murdering any more victims. I should talk to <<2>> about our next steps."

"103224356-0-63426";"I found a letter from <<1>> revealing her suspicions about <<2>>. She intended to leave the estate to her staff and dog, <<3>>. I should bring these findings to her niece, <<4>>."

"103224356-0-63694";"Maerenah and I followed Grivier's trail, but all we found were some dead bloodfiends and a scrap of paper. I should examine the paper and see if it's pertinent."
"103224356-0-63695";"Maerenah and I learned that Grivier made a deal with the Terror of the Weald to betray the townsfolk to save his own family. I should talk to Maerenah and see how she wants to proceed."

"103224356-0-63700";"Maerenah wants me to grab alchemical oil and combustion canisters from the alchemy shop. We can combine those to create a simple explosive to destroy the Terror's weapon stockpiles."
"103224356-0-63702";"We need to locate and destroy the weapon stockpiles that the vampire gang have placed around the town."
"103224356-0-63704";"Maerenah says it's time to enter the mine on the east side of town and find Balandrus, the Terror of the Weald."
"103224356-0-63705";"Maerenah suggests we destroy the bloodfiend dens where Balandrus is assembling his army before we deal with the Terror himself."
"103224356-0-63706";"We found Balandrus and his lieutenants. It's time to put an end to their attack on Sutch."
"103224356-0-63707";"We defeated Balandrus, the Terror of the Weald. Maerenah saw her friend Tham flee before the battle. We should head outside and try to find him."
"103224356-0-63711";"I need to enter Nonungalo to stop the necrotic ritual by removing the ritual items from the ruins and burning the bodies fueling the spell. The dead necromancer outside the ruins left behind a journal which may hold some clues."
"103224356-0-63712";"Inside Nonungalo, I need to burn the bodies fueling the spell and gather the ritual items. This will stop the undead necromancers."
"103224356-0-63713";"I halted the ritual by gathering the ritual items and burning the corrupted corpses. Priest Faric asked me to meet him outside the ruins."
"103224356-0-63722";"The Blind summoned a Mind Terror who has been controlling everyone I've fought in the Hall of Barons. The Darkshard won't stop sending enemies after me until it's dead."
"103224356-0-63723";"The Blind and her Blind Path cultists are still making good headway through Bedlam Veil. It sounds like she's getting closer to her goal. I'll have to hurry if I want to stop her."
"103224356-0-63724";"I should speak to Fa-Nuit-Hen."
"103224356-0-63725";"I found the Blind just before she was able to retrieve the Echonir. Killing her will stop her and the Blind Path from getting what they came here for."
"103224356-0-63726";"I should follow the Blind Path through Bedlam Veil. Maybe then I can reach the Blind."
"103224356-0-63727";"The Blind is somewhere ahead, but she left a Shattered Champion in my path. I can't keep chasing the Blind until the Shattered Champion is dead."
"103224356-0-63728";"The Blind is somewhere in the Hall of Barons. I should make my way through it and find her."
"103224356-0-63729";"I should talk to Fa-Nuit-Hen and see what's happening in their realm."
"103224356-0-63730";"I need to complete Bedlam Veil."
"103224356-0-63731";"I defeated foes in Bedlam Veil.\n\nI should find Urgarlag Chief-bane in my alliance's capital city."
"103224356-0-63732";"<<1>> presented me with another challenge: plant the Undaunted Banner before fighting The Blind."
"103224356-0-63733";"Urgarlag Chief-bane is waiting to speak to me once again in my alliance capital."
"103224356-0-63734";"Urgarlag Chief-bane is waiting to speak to me once again in my alliance capital."
"103224356-0-63736";"Urgarlag Chief-bane is waiting to speak to me once again in my alliance capital."
"103224356-0-63738";"Beragon wants me to use the Skein of Secrets so I can see the locations where he thinks King Nantharion has been using the Staff of Many Paths."
"103224356-0-63739";"Legionary Caepio told me Beragon wants to speak with me about King Nantharion's threat to West Weald. I should go to Beragon's townhouse in Skingrad and talk to him."
"103224356-0-63740";"The Skein of Secrets revealed two locations. I should talk to Beragon about how to proceed."
"103224356-0-63741";"I should investigate the locations revealed by the Skein of Secrets and report back to Beragon about what I discover."
"103224356-0-63748";"The Skein of Secrets revealed a new site where the Staff of Many Paths has been used. Beragon wants me to meet him there."
"103224356-0-63749";"I should explore the dungeons beneath the old fort. There may be another wildburn seed here."
"103224356-0-63750";"King Nantharion isn't here, but I found more wildburn seeds—and an Echonir memory. I should destroy the seeds and observe the memory."
"103224356-0-63755";"Beragon wants to talk to me about the Echonir memory we observed beneath Fort Dirich."
"103224356-0-63756";"Beragon told me he recognized the name Ithelia and Nantharion mentioned: Miscarcand. However, the ancient city has been lost for ages. I should use the Skein of Secrets to locate our foes."
"103224356-0-63757";"Beragon wants to start by visiting the Wood Elf town of Vashabar. He hopes to consult with a greenspeaker there about the wildburn seed we found in Ostumir."
"103224356-0-63758";"Beragon suggested we show the wildburn seed to Greenspeaker Darolith in Vashabar. I should find her and show her the seed."
"103224356-0-63759";"Beragon wants to warn King Nantharion that some of his followers might be connected to the Recollection before we head out to investigate the cart Greensinger Darolith told us about."
"103224356-0-63760";"Beragon and I reached King Nantharion. Beragon wants me to warn him about the Recollection. I should talk to him."
"103224356-0-63762";"I should look for the covered cart east of Leftwheal that Greenspeaker Darolith told me about. If it contains more wildburn seeds, we need to destroy them."
"103224356-0-63763";"I found another wildburn seed. This one looks charged and ready to sprout. I need to destroy it before that happens."
"103224356-0-63764";"I destroyed the wildburn seed, but it's obvious these Recollection forces were expecting us. If a Recollection spy is working in Vashabar, King Nantharion is in danger. I should talk to Beragon about our next move."
"103224356-0-63765";"I found Beragon near Hoperoot. He told me that the gate sentries were hostile to him and Tribune Alea, but the tribune has a plan to get inside. She's waiting for me near the gate."
"103224356-0-63766";"Tribune Alea called to me. I should go meet her."
"103224356-0-63767";"Tribune Alea distracted the sentries. Now's my chance to slip into Hoperoot undetected."
"103224356-0-63768";"Beragon thinks King Nantharion is likely on one of the tree-fort's upper platforms. I need to find a way up and look for the king."
"103224356-0-63769";"Recollection fighters in King Nantharion's new settlement can't be good. I need to reach the king."
"103224356-0-63770";"Tribune Alea wants to talk to me about the Echonir memory we just observed. I should speak to her."
"103224356-0-63771";"I need to continue my search for King Nantharion. He must be somewhere higher in the tree-fortress."
"103224356-0-63772";"We found King Nantharion talking to Greenspeaker Sorilen. They don't realize we're here. I should listen in on their conversation."
"103224356-0-63773";"King Nantharion is the leader of the Recollection! He's heading to the throne room with Greenspeaker Sorilen to prepare a new wildburn seed. I need to stop him."
"103224356-0-63774";"King Nantharion ordered Greenspeaker Sorilen to prevent me from interfering in his wildburn seed ritual. I need to defeat her."
"103224356-0-63775";"I fought my way past Greenspeaker Sorilen. Now I need to destroy the seed before King Nantharion completes his ritual."
"103224356-0-63776";"Stopping the ritual unleashed a wildburn eruption right here in Hoperoot. I need to escape!"
"103224356-0-63777";"We narrowly escaped from Hoperoot before the wildburn destroyed it. Beragon wants to speak with me before we leave. I should talk to him."
"103224356-0-63778";"We learned a lot about the Recollection at Hoperoot. We should return to Beragon's townhouse in Skingrad to regroup and plan our next move."
"103224356-0-63779";"I should talk to Beragon about what we learned at Hoperoot so we can plan our next move."
"103224356-0-63780";"Scruut brought me a plan from Hermaeus Mora to use the Daedric relics created to defeat Ithelia to heal the tears her presence caused in the fabric of reality. I need to take the relics to West Weald, the Telvanni Peninsula, and Apocrypha."
"103224356-0-63784";"The Daedric relics were placed and the spell was cast. The reality tears have been repaired and existence has been preserved. I should now return to Beragon's townhouse and check in with Leramil."
"103224356-0-63785";"I returned to Beragon's townhouse and was greeted by Tribune Alea. She says I need to go out on the balcony and talk to Beragon about some urgent matter."
"103224356-0-63786";"Scruut tells me that Hermaeus Mora wants to talk to me one final time. I should step through the portal she opened."
"103224356-0-63787";"Hermaeus Mora finished with Leramil and sent her away. I should talk to him now."
"103224356-0-63788";"I concluded my dealings with Hermaeus Mora. Ithelia is now truly a Forgotten Prince once more. I should return to Beragon's celebration."
"103224356-0-63789";"Beragon believes King Nantharion and Ithelia have discovered the Ayleid ruin of Miscarcand buried beneath Vashabar. We need to get to Vashabar now."
"103224356-0-63790";"I met Beragon and a wounded legionary outside the door to an Ayleid ruin. I should talk to Beragon about what happened here."
"103224356-0-63791";"It appears that Ithelia and King Nantharion opened a long-lost door to Miscarcand. I need to follow them inside and stop them from awakening the ancient city's Ayleid well."
"103224356-0-63792";"Beragon and I entered the lost city of Miscarcand. We need to catch up with Tribune Alea and find King Nantharion or the Ayleid well he's looking for."
"103224356-0-63793";"We caught up to Tribune Alea in Miscarcand. I should talk to her."
"103224356-0-63794";"The passage ahead is blocked by rubble. I should try to use Abolisher to create a portal."
"103224356-0-63795";"I used Abolisher to open a portal past the blocked passage. I should go on through."
"103224356-0-63796";"We need to continue searching Miscarcand for King Nantharion or the ruined city's Ayleid well."
"103224356-0-63797";"I found a lingering memory within Miscarcand. I should use the Echonir to see what it reveals."
"103224356-0-63798";"Shardmarshal Vargas appeared while I was observing the memory and trapped me inside! I need to find a way out."
"103224356-0-63799";"I found a portal that might lead me out of this memory, but it's closed. Maybe I can use Abolisher to open it again?"
"103224356-0-63800";"I used Abolisher to open a new portal. That's my way out of this ancient memory."
"103224356-0-63801";"I escaped the memory Shardmarshal Vargas tried to trap me in. I need to continue the search for King Nantharion."
"103224356-0-63802";"I discovered another lingering memory within Miscarcand. I should use the Echonir to observe it."
"103224356-0-63803";"We heard Beragon calling, but there's a locked gate and a rubble-filled passage between us. I should open a portal with Abolisher."
"103224356-0-63804";"We reached the Well of Miscarcand. King Nantharion is filling the Staff of Many Paths with energy the well. I need to stop him before he fills the staff and unleashes a massive wildburn."
"103224356-0-63805";"I defeated King Nantharion, but Shardmarshal Vargas used the power in the staff to fully restore Ithelia's power. I should return to Beragon's townhouse in Skingrad and discuss the implications with my allies."
"103224356-0-63806";"Leramil the Wise appeared in Beragon's townhouse. She wants to speak with me."
"103224356-0-63809";"Leramil told me she believes the Recollection is searching Niryastare for a relic created by the Daedric Prince Mephala. Beragon and I must retrieve it before they do. I should meet him at the ruins."
"103224356-0-63810";"I arrived at Niryastare. I should locate Beragon and speak with him."
"103224356-0-63811";"Beragon suggested scouting the area around Niryastare to find the best way into the ruins."
"103224356-0-63812";"Beragon and I found more than one way into the stockade surrounding Niryastare. I should talk to him about which entrance he thinks we should use."
"103224356-0-63813";"Beragon believes we'll find stairs down to Niryastare's vaults in the middle of the stockade. Or we could try another way to get in."
"103224356-0-63814";"We entered Niryastare's subterranean halls. The Skein of Secrets is hidden somewhere in here. I should keep exploring."
"103224356-0-63815";"We discovered a vault door protected by a darkened crystal—a great welkynd stone. I should speak with Beragon about how we get past the door."
"103224356-0-63816";"Beragon believes the long-dead great welkynd stone can be restored using lesser stones. We should look around for crystals that fit in the sockets of the Ayleid apparatus."
"103224356-0-63817";"There seems to be a strange glow in the air. Beragon thinks the Lamp of Clarity might reveal something here."
"103224356-0-63835";"I returned to Beragon's townhouse. I should talk to him about what I learned at Hastrel Hollow and Terthil Farm."
"103224356-0-63839";"The Skein of Secrets now shows a new location—Vashabar! I should talk to Beragon about this development."
"103224356-0-63840";"I used the Lamp of Clarity to reveal a lesser welkynd stone. I should return to the darkened great welkynd stone and see if it fits into one of the sockets."
"103224356-0-63842";"The lesser stone restored a glimmer of light to the great welkynd stone. I should locate and retrieve the three remaining lesser stones."
"103224356-0-63843";"I collected the remaining three lesser welkynd stones. I should return to the great welkynd stone and place each one in its proper socket."
"103224356-0-63844";"Reawakening the great welkynd stone of Niryastare revealed the entrance to a vault. Perhaps we'll find the Skein of Secrets within."
"103224356-0-63845";"A collapsed staircase blocks our exploration of the vault, but this looks like a problem I can solve with the blade Abolisher."
"103224356-0-63846";"I reached the relic known as the Skein of Secrets in Niryastare's vaults. I should take it."
"103224356-0-63847";"The wispy manifestation of a memory-echo appeared nearby. I should see what the Echonir reveals here."
"103224356-0-63848";"We observed the memory of an ancient confrontation between Ithelia and Hermaeus Mora. I should talk to Beragon about what we learned."
"103224356-0-63849";"We recovered the Skein of Secrets from Niryastare. We should return to Beragon's house in Skingrad."
"103224356-0-63857";"Legionary Caepio told me that Beragon, Tribune Alea, and Leramil are waiting for me at Beragon's townhouse in Skingrad. I should go see what they need."
"103224356-0-63859";"Beragon believes that we need to find Ithelia, who may have returned to her long-lost Oblivion plane, Mirrormoor. Perhaps the Skein of Secrets can help us find a way there."
"103224356-0-63860";"I used Abolisher to open a portal. I should step through and see where the portal leads."
"103224356-0-63861";"The portal led us to a strange desert ruin in a place Leramil called Fargrave. Beragon and Tribune Alea haven't yet emerged from the portal. I should talk to Leramil before we proceed."
"103224356-0-63862";"Masses of crystal encrust the ruins here. Leramil thinks they may be a a sign Ithelia passed through this area. I should follow the crystals and see where they lead."
"103224356-0-63863";"We found a door leading to the Inner Quarter of Fargrave. We should continue inside."
"103224356-0-63864";"The crystal path continues through this section of Fargrave. I should keep following it as I look for Shardmarshal Vargas and Ithelia."
"103224356-0-63865";"Shardmarshal Vargas banished Beragon and Tribune Alea to the Many Paths, so Leramil and I continued on our own. We found a lingering memory in the ruins. I should use the Echonir and see what it reveals."
"103224356-0-63866";"The Echonir memory revealed a long-ago conversation between Torvesard and Shardmarshal Vargas. I should consult with Leramil the Wise about what we heard."
"103224356-0-63869";"Leramil believes Ithelia came here for the Loom of the Untraveled Road that Shardmarshal Vargas was fixated with in that ancient memory. We need to find a way to reactivate this dormant portal."
"103224356-0-63870";"I used the mirrors to activate the dormant portal. Shardmarshal Vargas said the Loom of the Untraveled Road lies beyond it. I should enter the portal."
"103224356-0-63871";"I entered the Loom of the Untraveled Road. It's not an apparatus, but a place. I should explore this area."
"103224356-0-63872";"We appear to have reached a dead end. I should use the Skein of Secrets to locate Ithelia and find us a path."
"103224356-0-63873";"We encountered another Echonir memory inside the Loom of the Untraveled Road. I should see what it shows."
"103224356-0-63874";"Something went wrong when I tried to use the Skein of Secrets. I should let Leramil examine the Skein and talk to her about what happened."
"103224356-0-63877";"Shardmarshal Vargas redirected Leramil's portal, depositing us in Ithelia's ancient prison. However, there's a memory here. I should use the Echonir to reveal it."
"103224356-0-63878";"We appear to be trapped in Ithelia's ancient prison. Leramil the Wise wants us to look around for a way to escape."
"103224356-0-63879";"I found Beragon trapped within the broken mirrors of Ithelia's prison! Leramil thinks the Lamp of Clarity can pull him out of the Many Paths and back to our reality."
"103224356-0-63880";"I used Abolisher to create a portal out of Ithelia's prison. We should continue through the portal."
"103224356-0-63881";"We escaped from the prison Shardmarshal Vargas trapped us in. Ithelia and her scions are here. We need to reach the Loom's core."
"103224356-0-63882";"To reach the Loom, it appears I first need to go through Shardmarshal Vargas. I need to defeat her if I'm going to have a chance of destroying the Loom and stopping Ithelia from changing history and destroying this reality."
"103224356-0-63883";"Shardmarshal Vargas has fallen. Now I need to use Abolisher and destroy the Loom of the Untraveled Road."
"103224356-0-63884";"I defeated Shardmarshal Vargas and destroyed the Loom of the Untraveled Road. Now that West Weald and reality itself are safe, I should leave this place."
"103224356-0-63886";"According to <<1>> I will find Narsis Dren skulking around the local ruins. I should look for him there."
"103224356-0-63888";"<<1>> seeks to recover his lost notes, as well as information from the Recollection on what they've found so far. We should search the area for these items."
"103224356-0-63891";"I found a Recollection map and some documents. This may be valuable intelligence. I should gather whatever I can."
"103224356-0-63892";"I think there's a memory nearby. I should use the Echonir to reveal it and see what it contains."
"103224356-0-63894";"Search the Offices"
"103224356-0-63896";"The strange shawl we found activated an Echonir memory."
"103224356-0-63915";"I should head into the underground ruins and confer with <<1>> about what we found."
"103224356-0-63916";"I should talk to <<1>> about what we hope to find in Wendir."
"103224356-0-63917";"According to Narsis Dren, there is an altar inside the ruin that will grant us access to the Emblem of the Last King. To operate it, I need to collect three items from the Recollection: a Vial of Blood, Aromatic Wine, and Sacred Water."
"103224356-0-63928";"Scruut opened a portal to the instability she wants us to investigate. I should enter the portal and see where it leads."
"103224356-0-63930";"When I approached the reality tear, something happened. Scruut wants to talk to me about it."
"103224356-0-63937";"We found the altar that <<1>> had mentioned earlier. I should go to it with items we've gathered."
"103224356-0-63938";"We found the altar that <<1>>  mentioned earlier. Now I need to figure out which of these items is the correct one for activating the altar. I could talk to <<1>> for more information about the items."
"103224356-0-63943";"Now that the altar has been activated, we can find out what it is protecting ahead. I should catch up with <<1>>."
"103224356-0-63944";"I should check in with <<1>>. He seems excited about some kind of epitaph he's found."
"103224356-0-63945";"We found a tile puzzle in the center of Wendir. <<1>> thinks the solution is related to the nearby epitaph. I should take a look at the epitaph."
"103224356-0-63950";"Solving the tile puzzle disabled the magic surrounding the Emblem of the Last King. <<1>> wants to take it. I should probably keep him out of trouble."
"103224356-0-63951";"<<1>> wants to take the Emblem of the Last King, but there seems to be one final trap that he hasn't caught on to. I could warn him or just see what happens."
"103224356-0-63952";"I disarmed the final trap protecting the Emblem of the Last King. I should take the Emblem and bring it to Elfbetta, Narsis Dren's assistant, at her southern camp."
"103224356-0-63953";"<<1>> was petrified by the trap. I can use a nearby switch to disarm the mechanism and recover the Emblem without meeting a similar fate."
"103224356-0-63954";"I warned <<1>> before he triggered the trap, but he disregarded me. I should use that a nearby switch to disarm the trap before grasping the Emblem, so that I don't meet a similar fate."
"103224356-0-63955";"Beragon said to listen for calls for help as we search Ostumir for survivors. He asked that we keep a look out for his friend, Greenspeaker Sorilen, as well. I should search for any survivors I can aid."
"103224356-0-63957";"We found Greenspeaker Sorilen while rescuing survivors. She invited Beragon to Ostumir to show him something she found in the nearby Ayleid ruins. She wants us to meet her there."
"103224356-0-63959";"We arrived at the ruins but Greenspeaker Sorilen is nowhere to be seen. Beragon pointed out a dead body wearing the gear of the Recollection. I should examine the note lying next to the body."
"103224356-0-63960";"The note contained orders to the Recollection to take something called a wildburn seed from beneath the Ayleid ruins near Ostumir. I should talk to Beragon about what that might mean."
"103224356-0-63961";"Greenspeaker Sorilen wrote a note on the Recollection orders we found telling us she went deeper into the ruins. Beragon and I should enter the Ayleid ruins and search for his friend."
"103224356-0-63962";"Beragon and I entered the Ayleid ruins near Ostumir. While he wants to find out more about the wildburn seed and what the Recollection is up to, he's more anxious about finding his friend. I should search the ruins for Greenspeaker Sorilen."
"103224356-0-63963";"We found Greenspeaker Sorilen. I should talk to her and find out what she brought Beragon and I into these ruins to see."
"103224356-0-63964";"Greenspeaker Sorilen told Beragon and I that we can find the wildburn seed deeper inside the ruins. I should explore the area and hunt down this mysterious seed."
"103224356-0-63965";"Greenspeaker Sorilen revealed herself as a member of the Recollection. Beragon told me to get the wildburn seed while he goes after his friend. I should take the wildburn seed and follow after him."
"103224356-0-63966";"A villager fleeing Ostumir told me to find Beragon in a camp on the northern road out of the village. I should find the camp and talk to Beragon."
"103224356-0-63967";"The Echonir revealed a recent memory of Ithelia. I should observe it."
"103224356-0-63968";"We witnessed the memory of an event that occurred after we destroyed the Loom. I should talk to Leramil about what we just saw."
"103224356-0-63970";"Leramil believes we are in Fargrave, a planar crossroads of sorts. We should explore the area."
"103224356-0-63971";"Leramil can't get any closer to the inn because of the pain the tangle she perceives inflicts on her heightened senses. I should be able to cross the barrier formed by the tangle and get inside."
"103224356-0-63972";"Unlike Leramil, I was able to cross the barrier created by the tangled threads of fate. I can now enter the Outcast Inn and search for the source of the threat that initiated this disturbance."
"103224356-0-63973";"Strange shadowy figures wander inside the Outcast Inn. The innkeeper sounded nervous when he called me over. I should talk to him and find out what's happening."
"103224356-0-63974";"Innkeeper Brynmir told me the strange events around the inn scared his customers. It all started when the woman by the fire entered the inn. He asked me to get water from the well so he can make her a drink and get her talking."
"103224356-0-63975";"I fetched water from the well. I should bring it back to Innkeeper Brynmir so he can make a drink for the woman sitting by the fire."
"103224356-0-63976";"When I returned to the Outcast Inn, the woman asked for help. I should find out what she wants."
"103224356-0-63977";"The woman is the Daedric Prince, Ithelia. She lost control of her powers which created the threat around the inn. A name of a drink came to her mind—Sage's Dream. I should ask Innkeeper Brynmir about this drink."
"103224356-0-63978";"Innkeeper Brynmir believes he saw a book of obscure and ancient recipes in the back courtyard. It might contain a recipe for the Sage's Dream drink. I should search the courtyard to find the book."
"103224356-0-63979";"I found the book of obscure and ancient recipes in the courtyard's outbuilding. I should head back to Innkeeper Brynmir and show him the recipe for Sage's Dream."
"103224356-0-63980";"The innkeeper thinks he can make some substitutions for the traditional Sage's Dream ingredients. He asked that I find some sugar from the supplies in the cellar. I should head down there now."
"103224356-0-63984";"I went down into the cellar beneath the inn. It connects to some old ruins. I should look around for the sugar that Innkeeper Brynmir requested."
"103224356-0-63985";"Ithelia followed me into the cellar and we watched as a strange lamp appeared in front of us. I should talk to Ithelia to find out why she doesn't like this lamp."
"103224356-0-63986";"Ithelia feels disgust and hatred for the lamp in a way she doesn't understand. She asked that I pick up the lamp for her. I should take the lamp so we can examine it."
"103224356-0-63987";"After I picked up the lamp, glowing lights appeared on one side of the chamber. Ithelia said there's a path that wants to be explored and suggested I shine the lamp on it. I should use the lamp's light and see what happens."
"103224356-0-63988";"Shining the lamp's light on the anchor produced a portal. Ithelia tells me it's a door to another reality. She called it the Many Paths. I should go through the portal and see where it leads."
"103224356-0-63989";"Ithelia says we entered the Many Paths. I should explore this path and see where it leads."
"103224356-0-63990";"At the center of a large chamber containing a shrine, I found a different Ithelia from the one I met at the inn. She called me over to speak. I should talk to this alternate Ithelia."
"103224356-0-63994";"The Ithelia of this path tells me that Sage's Dream will help the Ithelia of my reality regain control of her power and disperse the tangled threads hanging over the inn. I can gather tirum weed here."
"103224356-0-63995";"I gathered the tirum weed and the alternate Ithelia opened a portal back to my reality. I should step through the portal and return to the inn's cellar."
"103224356-0-64002";"Leramil and Scruut prepared a ritual circle. I should place the Shattered Titan fragment in the center."
"103224356-0-64003";"I need to place the Daedric relics around the fragment to begin the ritual."
"103224356-0-64020";"The Lamp of Clarity helped Beragon escape whatever reality Vargas trapped him in. I should talk to him about where he's been."
"103224356-0-64021";"I freed Beragon and Tribune Alea with the Lamp of Clarity. Now I need to find a way to escape Ithelia's prison."
"103224356-0-64030";"Ithelia directed me to another path in the ruins. I should use the Lamp of Clarity to reveal the doorway to the Many Paths."
"103224356-0-64031";"The Lamp of Clarity revealed another doorway to the Many Paths. I should step through and see where this path leads."
"103224356-0-64032";"Ithelia and I arrived at different location in the same shrine as before. However, the place feels gloomy this time. Ithelia urged me forward to find the next ingredient. I should explore this new path."
"103224356-0-64033";"This alternate Ithelia seems depressed and resentful over her approaching imprisonment. However, she directed me to the next ingredient, harkfruit. I should take the harkfruit so I can leave this path."
"103224356-0-64034";"I gathered the harkfruit for Sage's Dream. Ithelia learned to open a portal and created a doorway back to the inn. I should step through."
"103224356-0-64035";"Ithelia directed me to another path in the ruins. I should use the Lamp of Clarity to reveal the doorway to the Many Paths."
"103224356-0-64036";"The Lamp of Clarity revealed another doorway to the Many Paths. I should step through and see where this path leads."
"103224356-0-64037";"This time the Many Paths led us to a shrine caught in the midst of battle as the forces of Ithelia and Hermaeus Mora clash. I need to explore this path and find the final ingredient."
"103224356-0-64038";"Torvesard directed me to the ingredient we need, lute berries. I should gather them and leave before the Ithelia of this realm destroys everything that exists upon this path."
"103224356-0-64039";"I gathered the lute berries. Now I should use the portal opened by the Ithelia of my reality to return to the inn's cellar."
"103224356-0-64040";"I successfully created a Sage's Dream drink. Maybe the first one in thousands of years. I should go upstairs so I can present the drink to Ithelia."
"103224356-0-64042";"Ithelia drank the Sage's Dream and instantly seems better. I should talk to her and find out what she's thinking."
"103224356-0-64055";"<<1>> is suspicious of the note. The facts in the note do not line up—<<2>> was not working the day <<3>> died and, with the discovery of the memorial, the visiting Uriel Weatherleah may be an imposter. Mizzik thinks we should speak to him."
"103224356-0-64060";"I should seek out Leramil the Wise in the Elden Root Outlaws Refuge. She can tell me what we must do to stop Torvesard."
"103224356-0-64061";"I should find Leramil the Wise in the Mournhold Outlaws Refuge. She can tell me what we must do to stop Torvesard."
"103224356-0-64091";"I disarmed the final trap protecting the Emblem. I should bring it to Elfbetta, Narsis Dren's assistant, at her southern camp."
"103224356-0-64092";"Narsis did not heed my warning, but I recovered the Emblem. I should deliver it to Dren's assistant, Elfbetta, at her southern camp."
"103224356-0-64150";"Constable Yabren asked me to interview a few of the townsfolk, notably Ghrakug, the ranch overseer, and the quarry boss—all people her father was planning to interview before he died. She also asked me to examine her father's office."
"103224356-0-64151";"Constable Yabren's father's journal noted that he planned to interview the owners of the ranch and the quarry next. Yabren asked me to do that while she looks into the death of the town healer."
"103224356-0-64152";"I met with Baron Carvain and Lady Raxalee. Now I should meet Constable Yabren at the Stonechip Gambling Den to tell her about my investigations."
"103224356-0-64153";"Ghrakug passed along a message from Constable Yabren. She wants me to meet her at Carvain Manor and Lady Raxalee's tower to help her search for evidence pertaining to fatigue fever."
"103224356-0-64154";"Letters and other documents found at Carvain Manor and Raxalee Tower suggest they might be involved in the suspicious deaths associated with fatigue fever. I need to investigate Zeggar's Blind next."
"103224356-0-64155";"I reached the location northeast of Ontus known as Zeggar's Blind. I should look around and see what's going on out here."
"103224356-0-64156";"Now that I destroyed the alchemical equipment used to make the fatigue fever elixir, I should meet Constable Yabren at the Stonechip Gambling Den."
"103224356-0-64157";"Constable Yabren isn't here and Ghrakug has been injured. I should talk to him."
"103224356-0-64158";"Before he succumbed to his wounds, Ghrakug told me the mercenaries that attacked him took Constable Yabren to the Ontus reservoir, north of town near the river. I should get there as soon as I can."
"103224356-0-64159";"Baron Carvain and Lady Raxalee are issuing orders to their mercenaries. I should hear what they're talking about before I act."
"103224356-0-64160";"Baron Carvain ordered his mercenaries to kill me and dump the barrels of elixir into the reservoir. I need to deal with them before I can catch up with Constable Yabren."
"103224356-0-64161";"I stopped the mercenaries. Now to catch up with Constable Yabren and find Baron Carvain and Lady Raxalee."
"103224356-0-64162";"Inside the Ontus Reservoir, Baron Carvain and Lady Raxalee are issuing orders and I see Constable Yabren bound nearby. I should set her free."
"103224356-0-64163";"Looks like Constable Yabren caught Baron Carvain and Lady Raxalee. I should talk to her."
"103224356-0-64164";"I helped Constable Yabren learn the truth about her father's death and bring his killers to justice. Now I should talk to her about what happens next for her and the town of Ontus."
"103224356-0-64215";"I arrived at the Stonechip Gambling Den but Constable Yabren isn't here. Ghrakug called out to me, however. I should hear what he has to say."
"103224356-0-64216";"<<1>> discovered <<2>> dead in the library. I should investigate the scene."
"103224356-0-64226";"I should travel to Fort Colovia and find a way inside."
"103224356-0-64229";"Betu the dog has been poisoned! Otho seems to have an idea of how to help Betu. I should speak to him."
"103224356-0-64230";"I destroyed the wildburn seed before the ritual was completed. I should listen to what Nantharion is saying, because something is going very wrong."
"103224356-0-64232";"We came upon a desk and Constable Yabren spotted a key. I should take the key."
"103224356-0-64234";"I need to enter Varen's Watch and look for these rubble piles."
"103224356-0-64235";"I need to find the desk that this key opens and see if I can learn anything about what's going on here."
"103224356-0-64236";"The key unlocked the desk and revealed a letter from Baron Carvain and Lady Raxalee to Alchemist Surius."
"103224356-0-64237";"I should enter Legion's Rest so I can look for crystaljack venom crystals."
"103224356-0-64238";"I need to go to the Haldain Lumber Camp south of Skingrad and recover Legion tool packs loaned to the camp workers while they awaited the arrival of their own supplies."
"103224356-0-64241";"I should enter Fyrelight Cave and see if I can find evidence of tharrikers inside."
"103224356-0-64242";"I should enter Nonungalo so I can begin my investigation of the ruins."
"103224356-0-64243";"Tribune Alea Idolus wants to survey the attack before deciding on a plan. She told me of an overlook near the entrance where a marketplace is often held. I should go to the overlook with her."
"103224356-0-64244";"We arrived at the marketplace overlook near Feldagard Keep's entrance. Daedra already surround the area with a large force grouped at a breach in the wall. I should discuss next steps with Tribune Alea."
"103224356-0-64245";"Entering the keep from the front looks impossible. Tribune Alea knows of a side entrance, though. I should find the entrance and enter Feldagard Keep."
"103224356-0-64247";"I recovered the remedy for Betu from the pantry. I need to return to the hall to help Betu."
"103224356-0-64248";"Betu seems to be recovering from the poison thanks to the remedy! I should talk to Mizzik about the note I found with the imposter."
"103224356-0-64249";"Elfbetta asked me to help Narsis Dren recover the Ayleid treasure from the ruins of Wendir. I should talk to him."
"103224356-0-64250";"Beragon figured out the Recollection is interested in the Ayleid ruin of Niryastare and asked me to meet him there. However, Leramil the Wise wants to talk to me before I leave."
"103224356-0-64251";"Hermaeus Mora appeared and wishes to speak with me. I should see what the Prince of Fate has to say."
"103224356-0-64255";"Tribune Alea and I made it into Feldagard Keep through the side entrance. She wants us to track down Commander Merian who leads the legionaries here. I should search the keep for the commander."
"103224356-0-64256";"We found Commander Merian leading legionaries in the keep's defense. He warned us about Daedra climbing the walls to get in and asked us to stop them. I should slow their assault by burning the ropes and setting traps."
"103224356-0-64257";"I set traps against the Daedric forces and burned the ropes they used to climb into the keep. It appears I slowed their assault. I should find the main courtyard and meet up with Commander Merian."
"103224356-0-64258";"Tribune Alea and I found Commander Merian near a broken ballista. He ordered the tribune to start repairs and told me that I get the fun part. I should talk to the commander to find out what that means."
"103224356-0-64259";"Commander Merian told me of his plan to hold back the Daedra with a wall of fire while peppering them with ballista bolts. He wants me to help with this plan. First, I should grab a bucket of oil."
"103224356-0-64260";"Commander Merian plans to make a wall of fire to hold back the Daedra. I should use the bucket of oil to pour oil on the barricade."
"103224356-0-64261";"I repaired the ballista with the parts I found. It's now ready for combat. I should get on the ballista and prepare to execute Commander Merian's plan."
"103224356-0-64262";"The plan worked. We held back the waves of Daedra so I could target them with the ballista. Just when the weapon broke again, a group of Daedra stormed the courtyard through the north door. I should head there and take out the attackers."
"103224356-0-64263";"We entered the keep's barracks, and Tribune Alea wants to talk to me. I should find out what's on her mind."
"103224356-0-64265";"Tribune Alea believes the remaining Daedric forces have come from somewhere inside the keep. She suggested we go into the barracks below and look around. I should join her on the search."
"103224356-0-64266";"Tribune Alea Idolus and I followed a trail of Daedra through the keep's barracks. We still haven't found the source of their incursion. I should enter the barracks armory and continue my search."
"103224356-0-64267";"After a search through the barracks, Tribune Alea and I entered the armory below the keep. There, we found the commander of the Daedric forces. I should watch to see what she's up to."
"103224356-0-64268";"While we watched, Shardmarshal Vargas used a blade to open a portal inside the armory. Daedric reinforcements came through and the portal closed. I should talk to Tribune Alea about this development."
"103224356-0-64269";"We have a plan to defeat Shardmarshal Vargas and take the portal-opening blade from her. Tribune Alea told me get in place near the gateway, then we'll attack from both sides. I should get to my designated position as planned."
"103224356-0-64270";"After Shardmarshal Vargas opened another portal, Tribune Alea impulsively attacked her. This wasn't the plan. I should try to get to Tribune Alea and help her."
"103224356-0-64271";"Tribune Alea attacked Shardmarshal Vargas before we could execute the plan. They fell into the portal created by the blade. The last thing I heard was Tribune Alea telling me to follow her. I should go through the portal and find them both."
"103224356-0-64272";"Tribune Alea Idolus and I defeated the Shardborn. Shardmarshal Vargas retreated and left her sword behind. She called it Abolisher. I should take the magical blade."
"103224356-0-64273";"I entered the portal and arrived in a place very different than Feldagard Keep. As they fought, Tribune Alea Idolus knocked Abolisher from Shardmarshal Vargas's hand. In response, Vargas summoned Daedra to fight us. I should eliminate the enemy."
"103224356-0-64274";"Now that I have Abolisher, I should try to open a portal the way we saw Shardmarshal Vargas do it. If I slash the blade through the air, maybe I can create a portal back to the keep."
"103224356-0-64275";"I mimicked Shardmarshal Vargas and used Abolisher to open a portal. I should step through and hope it returns us to Feldagard Keep."
"103224356-0-64276";"The portal returned us to Feldagard Keep. I should talk to Commander Merian to update him on what happened beneath the keep and with Shardmarshal Vargas."
"103224356-0-64277";"Laeni asked me to speak to her Aunt Ciiril. Ciiril might be willing to help the couple start a new life away from Vashabar. I should be able to find her at the beer garden in the village."
"103224356-0-64279";"I found Agawen Ciiril. I need to ask her if she can gather supplies for the couple."
"103224356-0-64280";"Ciiril agreed to help the couple. She gave me some jagga and asked me to speak with Nedolir and Minth. Perhaps the fathers will see reason now that their children plan to leave town. They should be in pod houses near the village center."
"103224356-0-64282";"Nedolir and Minth love their children but strongly oppose a marriage. I should find Agawen Ciiril at the stables to see how she's coming along with the supplies."
"103224356-0-64283";"Agawen Ciiril asked that I speak to  <<1>> and <<2>>, family friends. She hopes they might be able to talk the couple into staying. Both should be near the center of the village."
"103224356-0-64293";"I destroyed the wildburn seeds King Nantharion planted at the sites revealed by the Skein of Secrets. I should return to Beragon's townhouse in Skingrad and tell Beragon what I learned."
"103224356-0-64296";"The survivor I found in Hastrel Hollow told me the Recollection attackers went into nearby ruins. I should investigate."
"103224356-0-64297";"The old well led down to a cave with an underground stream. I should look around down here."
"103224356-0-64301";"The High Elf is named Tanlorin. They're worried their friends may also have run into some trouble. Tanlorin asked me to join them at Monkey's Rest. I should go to Monkey's Rest and have a look around."
"103224356-0-64302";"I should speak to Tanlorin to find out what they plan to do now that we saved their friends from the Ceythalmor threat."
"103224356-0-64303";"Tanlorin indicated that the Gardener likes riddles, so likely there's something to figure out in this invitation he sent along. I should read it to see what it says."
"103224356-0-64304";"With Snapdragon rescued and news of a traitor in the Garland Ring's ranks, Tanlorin wishes to talk about what's next."
"103224356-0-64306";"We exposed Wisteria as the traitor within the Garland Ring. I should speak with Tanlorin again to see what they want to do next."
"103224356-0-64307";"Tanlorin wants to use Snapdragon's journal to retrace Wisteria's steps. They want to start with a location along the coast, southwest of Seaside Sanctuary in Greenshade."
"103224356-0-64308";"Wisteria and the Ceythalmor have been defeated. The Garland Ring is set to become something new, and Tanlorin feels ready to bring this chapter of their life to a close."
"103224356-0-64311";"<<1>> mentioned a Wood Elf custom called the Rite of Propagation. He believes it might offer a solution to Laeni and Clendagal. He directed me to the Wilderhall, where the village preserves and honors its history."
"103224356-0-64312";"I found an old scroll detailing the Rite of Propagation in the Wilderhall. The rite may offer the couple a way to appeal to the village for permission to marry. Spinner Belwelas suggested I talk to Agawen Ciiril before talking to Laeni and Clendagal."
"103224356-0-64313";"Agawen Ciiril is excited about the possibility that Laeni and Clendagal might be able to stay in the village. I need to take the scroll detailing the rite to the couple. They should be in their hidden meeting spot within a nearby overgrown ruin."
"103224356-0-64315";"The couple need to gather symbolic items to complete the Rite of Propagation. They asked me to help. Laeni and I will go to the site where the village began growing Vashabar, while Clendagal will accompany me into a nearby Ayleid ruin."
"103224356-0-64316";"I need to return to the center of Vashabar and find Ciiril so I can assist Laeni and Clendagal complete the Rite of Propagation."
"103224356-0-64317";"Nedolir called out, asking for an explanation of what's going on. I should speak to him before the Rite begins."
"103224356-0-64318";"Everything is ready. I should assist Laeni and Clendagal in enacting the Rite of Propagation."
"103224356-0-64319";"I found a campsite in Hastrel Hollow with several dead Wood Elves. There's one survivor here. I should talk to him."
"103224356-0-64320";"Ithelia and Torvesard sealed the entrance to Hermaeus Mora's private sanctum with magical wards. I must use the Skein of Secrets to locate these wards."
"103224356-0-64326";"The Skein of Secrets pointed me to a Colovian farmstead. I should investigate the site."
"103224356-0-64327";"I should investigate Hastrel Hollow and see if I can determine what King Nantharion was doing there."
"103224356-0-64330";"This farmstead looks abandoned. I should look around for clues about what happened here."
"103224356-0-64332";"I found a note beside a dead farmer. The Recollection seemed to be interested in the nearby old well. I should investigate."
"103224356-0-64333";"I should look at the Skein of Secrets. It may have new clues about King Nantharion's location."
"103224356-0-64357";"We need to find Beragon and continue our search for King Nantharion or the ancient Ayleid well."
"103224356-0-64362";"Fennorian made a counteragent to help the victims of Lord Gallio Valente's experiments. I should pick it up and pour it on on them."
"103224356-0-64363";"The Skein of Secrets revealed the location of the Ayleid ruin of Wendir, but we have no idea why. We can only assume that we can pick up Ithelia's trail there, so I need to head to Wendir."
"103224356-0-64364";"The spot marked by the Skein doesn't seem significant, but Leramil arrived and says she senses an anomaly. She suggests I use Abolisher and see what happens."
"103224356-0-64365";"I need to fling the pies Apprentice Mogh gave me at the rival bakers, Chef Zee-Ram and Chef Banelle. I also need to recover Chef Dononlon's special flour blend and Mogh's mix of essential sugars."
"103224356-0-64366";"With my help, Apprentice Mogh was able to finally create his Jubilee Cake. Now that he's finished, I should speak with him to receive my reward."
"103224356-0-64376";"Tanlorin has a damaged lattice that should let them speak to another Garland Ring member by the name of Hyacinth. Tanlorin wants me to speak with Hyacinth while they try to fix it."
"103224356-0-64377";"We found a few clues, but Tanlorin's friends aren't at Monkey's Rest. I should talk with Tanlorin and see what they think about the items we discovered here."
"103224356-0-64386";"Constable Yabren asked me to start our investigation by becoming familiar with other recent deaths that have plagued the town. She suggested I start by examining the newer grave markers."
"103224356-0-64388";"I examined the most-recent grave markers as Constable Yabren suggested. I should talk to her about anything I noticed."
"103224356-0-64389";"I spoke to Ghrakug, the ranch overseer, and the quarry boss. And I found Constable Ulbren's notebook in the constable's office. I should return to Yabren and tell her what I learned."
"103224356-0-64390";"I should watch the memory I revealed using the Echonir."
"103224356-0-64391";"This arch was important to Shardmarshal Vargas. She was drawn to this place and spent a lot of time here in the centuries before she recovered her memories. Perhaps the Lamp of Clarity can reveal why."
"103224356-0-64393";"Zerith-var wants to travel with me, it seems. I should speak to him once more before we get underway."
"103224356-0-64398";"Beragon told me Leramil the Wise requested my help at a place called the Outcast Inn. I should investigate, and then return to Skingrad to check in with Beragon."
"103224356-0-64399";"Beragon told me that Tribune Alea went to Feldagard Keep to warn them about the imminent attack we learned about at Hoperoot. I should go help her, and then return to check in with Beragon."
"103224356-0-64400";"Beragon was concerned about situations at Feldagard Keep and the Outcast Inn. Since my investigation of those sites is complete, I should talk to him about what happened and what I learned."
"103224356-0-64401";"Beragon told me my help is needed at Feldagard Keep and Outcast Inn. I must help Tribune Alea and Leramil the Wise, then return to Skingrad and check in with him."
"103224356-0-64402";"Cantor Krin'ze suggested I look for the spirit of a little cat as I investigate the star that fell near Moonmont."
"103224356-0-64403";"We found Lord Gallio Valente's laboratory. I should speak to Fennorian about our next steps."
"103224356-0-64404";"I should search for Lord Gallio Valente's alchemical laboratory."
"103224356-0-64419";"I halted the ritual by gathering the ritual items and burning the corrupted corpses. Priest Faric asked me to meet him outside the ruins."
"103224356-0-64422";"The spirit cat I encountered at Moonmont seems to want me to follow it. I should see where it leads."
"103224356-0-64423";"The spirit cat I met near Moonmont led me to the door of an old tomb. I should enter the tomb and see what's inside."
"103224356-0-64424";"I encountered a Khajiit in this old tomb I was led to by the spirit cat. I should speak to him and find out what he's doing here."
"103224356-0-64425";"The Khajiit I found in the tomb is Zerith-var. He asked for my help in finding his moonclaw, as well as anything else that might explain why he awoke in a tomb. I should search the tomb and see what I can find."
"103224356-0-64427";"I found the armlet Zerith described to me, as well as a tablet bearing his name and an ancient crescent blade. I should bring the items I found to him."
"103224356-0-64428";"Zerith-var wants to meet in Rawl'kha to see if the Order of the Hidden Moon still exists. Zerith wants to determine why Azurah sent him back after his death in what I assume was the First Era. I should make sure he doesn't get into any trouble."
"103224356-0-64429";"Zerith-var told me the location of an old shrine for the Order of the Hidden Moon. It's hidden around back of the Temple of Two-Moons Dance. I should search for it."
"103224356-0-64430";"The entrance to the Hidden Moon shrine was right where Zerith-var said it would be. I should go inside with him."
"103224356-0-64431";"The Hidden Moon shrine Zerith-var sought in Rawl'kha appears to be abandoned and filled with the bodies of fallen members of his order. I should speak with Zerith-var about it."
"103224356-0-64432";"Zerith-var wants me to look through a nearby book of rites of the Hidden Moon to refresh his memory for a simple consecration blessing."
"103224356-0-64433";"Zerith-var wishes to sanctify the dead in this sanctuary and ask Azurah for guidance. To do this, he needs moon-sugar water. I should give Zerith a moment to mourn and search for moon-sugar water in the temple nearby."
"103224356-0-64434";"I found some moon-sugar water. I should return it to Zerith-var at the Hidden Moon sanctuary in Rawl'kha."
"103224356-0-64435";"I returned to Zerith-var with the moon-sugar water he asked for. Per his instructions, I should pour it into the basin so he can perform the rite to consecrate the remains here."
"103224356-0-64436";"Zerith-var is performing the rite of purification and asking Azurah for guidance. I should wait for him to finish."
"103224356-0-64440";"Tanlorin believes Wisteria and Oleander are somewhere inside Toothmaul Gully. We should head inside and use Tanlorin's tracker fly to search for them."
"103224356-0-64445";"To find their friends, Tanlorin needs me to gather river lilies near Phaer and to purchase some silver dust from a friend of theirs named Chirrabi in Mathiisen. After I get the items, I should meet Tanlorin near the rock west of Skywatch."
"103224356-0-64446";"I should talk to Tanlorin about what Hyacinth said. Perhaps they will have an idea about what to do next."
"103224356-0-64447";"Tanlorin made the special resonating fluid keyed to Wisteria using the ingredients I gathered. I should collect it and meet her at Toothmaul Gully."
"103224356-0-64448";"I found the river lilies and acquired the silver dust. I should meet Tanlorin near the big rock west of Skywatch."
"103224356-0-64449";"Zerith-var asked Azurah for guidance and the basin in the sanctuary flared with blue flames. Zerith seemed surprised by this. I should speak with him."
"103224356-0-64450";"Zerith-var explained that the blue flames are a signal of Rajaska piercing the veil of Nirn somewhere nearby. He marked my map at a ruin called Claw's Strike in Reaper's March. I should meet him there and help him find the Rajaska."
"103224356-0-64451";"We encountered a Rajaska who turned Cantor Ta'khida into a type of dro-m'Athra called a Rajaska. I should help Zerith-var defeat Ta'khida-morna."
"103224356-0-64452";"Cantor Krin'ze, the Twilight Cantor I met earlier, is here at Claw's Strike. It looks like she and her fellow Twilight Cantors are in trouble. I should talk to her and find out what the situation is."
"103224356-0-64453";"After defeating the cantor-turned-Rajaska Ta'khida-morna, Zerith-var did something to cleanse her spirit. I should speak to him about what just happened."
"103224356-0-64454";"Zerith explained that to help his people further, we need to restore the magic of his moonclaw. He says he can do this at the Temple of the Dark Moon in Khenarthia. I should travel through the portal he opened to go there."
"103224356-0-64457";"Zerith-var's portal took me to Khenarthi's Roost. I should follow Zerith to the Temple of the Dark Moon."
"103224356-0-64473";"We should find a safe spot inside Toothmaul Gully to activate Tanlorin's tracker fly."
"103224356-0-64474";"I should follow the tracker fly through Toothmaul Gully. It should lead us to the missing Wisteria and Oleander."
"103224356-0-64476";"The tracking fly led us to a side chamber deep in Toothmaul Gully. We should look for any sign of Wisteria and Oleander."
"103224356-0-64478";"With Wisteria freed, Tanlorin thinks its best we speak outside of Toothmaul Gully. There's an exit nearby."
"103224356-0-64479";"We found Wisteria locked in a cage. I should talk to her while Tanlorin works to unlock the cage door."
"103224356-0-64480";"We saved Wisteria, but Oleander was killed by the interrogators. I should speak with Tanlorin and see what they want to do next."
"103224356-0-64481";"Tanlorin showed me the entrance to Hyacinth's hideout, what the Garland Ring calls a greenhouse. I should go inside with Tanlorin."
"103224356-0-64482";"Tanlorin thinks we should look around for any signs as to where Hyacinth was taken, in hopes he somehow left a clue behind."
"103224356-0-64484";"After putting on armor, Tanlorin asked me to meet them at Rulanyil's Fall to search for Hyacinth."
"103224356-0-64485";"I should search Rulanyil's Fall for the entrance to the Ceythalmor hideout where they are keeping Hyacinth. The note said the entrance would be marked by a red banner."
"103224356-0-64487";"We found the Ceythalmor hideout, but we still need to find Hyacinth."
"103224356-0-64489";"We freed Hyacinth from his magical restraints. He wants to speak with me."
"103224356-0-64490";"Tanlorin wants to speak with me after everything we've done today to help their friends. Hyacinth also says Tanlorin is free to tell me the truth about the Garland Ring."
"103224356-0-64495";"Tanlorin wants me to pour the resonating fluid into the tracker fly. They say we should be able to follow it to the missing Wisteria, and hopefully Tanlorin's friend Oleander, as well."
"103224356-0-64499";"<<1>> instructed me to read the epitaph he has found. He thinks it holds a clue to solving the nearby tile puzzle and releasing the Emblem."
"103224356-0-64500";"I need to continue my search for King Nantharion. He must be somewhere higher in the tree-fortress."
"103224356-0-64501";"We found a strange page of orders, but still no sign of Wisteria or Oleander. We should continue deeper into the hidden chamber."
"103224356-0-64506";"Count Calantius of Skingrad and Greenspeaker Darolith of Vashabar are here. The count wants to have a word with me. I should talk to him."
"103224356-0-64507";"Beragon suggested I store the depleted relics in the display case. I should place them there now."
"103224356-0-64508";"I should return to Beragon's townhouse in Skingrad and rejoin my allies."
"103224356-0-64509";"Now that I returned to Beragon's townhouse, I should find Beragon and make sure he's all right."
"103224356-0-64521";"Irnard opened a portal to Sunnamere, where Votary Nahlia is waiting for me. I should seek her out."
"103224356-0-64522";"Votary Nahlia greeted me and suggested we head inside. I should proceed into the study to seek out this anomaly."
"103224356-0-64523";"The unstable magic is a portal at the far end of the study. I need to speak to Votary Nahlia to find out what this is all about."
"103224356-0-64525";"Votary Nahlia has stabilized the portal. We should enter together."
"103224356-0-64526";"Votary Nahlia and I entered the strange portal. The source of the untamed magic seems to be coming from further in."
"103224356-0-64527";"I need to meet my allies at Beragon's townhouse in Skingrad and figure out a way to repair the tears in the fabric of reality."
"103224356-0-64540";"Leramil created a portal to help us navigate the Loom. I should enter it and continue exploring."
"103224356-0-64543";"Tanlorin thinks something is wrong. The greenhouse is ransacked and there's a foul smell. I should speak with Tanlorin."
"103224356-0-64545";"I found the Ithelia for this reality. She's kneeling on the floor and looks despondent. I should talk to her and learn what happened to her."
"103224356-0-64546";"As I entered the large shrine room, I could see an enraged Ithelia in the background. A Daedra that I recognize from the first path approached and asked to speak. I should talk to him and find out what's going on."
"103224356-0-64547";"Maerenah suggests we destroy the bloodfiend dens where Balandrus is assembling his army before we deal with the Terror himself."
"103224356-0-64548";"We destroyed the weapon caches and collapsed the bloodfiend dens. Now I should speak to Maerenah about how we deal with Balandrus, the Terror of the Weald."
"103224356-0-64549";"We need to find Balandrus, the Terror of the Weald, and end his reign of terror."
"103224356-0-64550";"We found Maerenah's friend Tham. She asked me to talk to him while she composes herself."
"103224356-0-64552";"A strange blast of magical energy blew through the unstable portal. Nahlia asked me to investigate a few things that appeared in the study while she stabilizes the threshold."
"103224356-0-64558";"While Tanlorin weakens the ward holding Hyacinth, they want me to deactivate the control pillars so they can free him."
"103224356-0-64562";"The Temple of the Dark Moon has been destroyed. This complicates Zerith-var's plan to restore the magic in his moonclaw. I should speak to Zerith about our next steps."
"103224356-0-64563";"Zerith-var believes something imbued with the power of the Dark Moon could still be among the ruins of the temple. I should look through the ruins for something holding magic or of ritual significance."
"103224356-0-64566";"I found an order of assassination for Zerith-var and myself issued by the grand inquisitor of the Torval Curiata. I also found a black pearl among the ruins of the Temple of the Dark Moon. I should speak with Zerith about both of these things."
"103224356-0-64567";"Zerith-var and I restored the magic of his moonclaw. Now he senses another incursion of dro-m'Athra and opened a portal to take us to it. I should use Zerith's portal to learn more."
"103224356-0-64568";"Zerith-var's portal dropped us outside the Vile Manse, where we found Cantor Krin'ze and High Cantor Viti of the Twilight Cantors. I should speak with Cantor Krin'ze to learn more about what's going on here."
"103224356-0-64569";"Cantor Krin'ze says her fellow Twilight Cantors were dragged deep into the Vile Manse by dro-m'Athra and the Rajaska we witnessed in Claw's Strike. Krin'ze thinks it's too late to save them. I should speak to Zerith about what to do next."
"103224356-0-64570";"Zerith-var seems confident that his Hidden Moon training can save the Twilight Cantors inside the Vile Manse. He asked for my help in saving them. I should head inside the Vile Manse to search for the lost Twilight Cantors."
"103224356-0-64573";"Zerith-var and I found the undercroft prison. Since his moonclaw led us here, the Rajaska and the missing Twilight Cantors are probably inside. We should head inside and see what awaits us."
"103224356-0-64574";"We were too late to stop Ravith-morna from turning Cantor Zayabi into a Rajaska. Now we have to defeat Zayabi-morna so that Zerith can use his moonclaw to cleanse her corrupted spirit."
"103224356-0-64575";"We defeated Zayabi-morna. Just like with Cantor Ta'khida, Zerith-var cleansed her spirit from the Rajaska's corruption. Zerith opened a portal. I should leave with him and the surviving Twilight Cantors."
"103224356-0-64576";"We seem to have found the source of the magical disturbance. I should speak to Votary Nahlia about what to do next."
"103224356-0-64577";"Votary Nahlia ordered me to seal the doors in the library while she tries to stabilize the magic arcing off the altar."
"103224356-0-64580";"A talking crow accused Votary Nahlia of causing this magical disturbance. I should speak to the Crow."
"103224356-0-64581";"The Crow has a plan to fix the altar. I need to find a new focusing crystal in the east wing of the Scholarium."
"103224356-0-64582";"I found a new focusing crystal for the altar. I should approach the altar and follow the Crow's instructions on what to do next."
"103224356-0-64583";"The altar's crystal has been replaced, but one last step remains. I'll need to follow the Crow's instructions carefully."
"103224356-0-64584";"I repaired the altar and scribed something called a Grimoire. I should speak to the Crow to understand what just happened."
"103224356-0-64585";"The Crow wants me to continue on a journey to learn more about Scribing, but encouraged me to speak to Votary Nahlia first."
"103224356-0-64588";"I found Zerith-var in Rawl'kha having a terse interaction with a guard. I should speak to him."
"103224356-0-64589";"The message from the Gardener included some sort of riddle. I should talk to Tanlorin and see what they think it means."
"103224356-0-64591";"The riddle pointed to Belarata in Malabal Tor, south of Vulkwasten. We should travel there and find a ring of some sort growing on a nearby islet."
"103224356-0-64592";"We found another message in the middle of a ring of mushroom. I should examine it and see what it reveals."
"103224356-0-64593";"The clue contains a sketch that appears to be a map of sorts. I should talk to Tanlorin and see if they recognize the location depicted."
"103224356-0-64595";"Tanlorin thinks the sketch is directing us to a structure of woven branches somewhere near Deepwoods. I should search the area for a landmark that matches the sketch."
"103224356-0-64596";"The illusory bird recited another riddle when I touched it. I should talk with Tanlorin and see what they make of the clue."
"103224356-0-64597";"The illusory bird's clue seems to be directing us to the Ritual Mundus Stone in southern Malabal Tor. Once we find it, we'll need to gather some royal lavender to reveal a hidden door."
"103224356-0-64599";"Tanlorin suggests I place the royal lavender in the prominently placed bowl near the Ritual Stone."
"103224356-0-64600";"We entered the greenhouse. Tanlorin wants me to find and talk to the Gardener while they look around."
"103224356-0-64601";"The Gardener asked us to find a former member of the Garland Ring. Lirinisse, code named Snapdragon. I should head for the Mages Guild in Skywatch, which is the last place the Gardener knew her to be."
"103224356-0-64602";"The adepts told us that Snapdragon was arrested by a local reeve named Nardarmor. They don't know where she was taken, but we may be able to find more information in the reeve's office inside Skywatch Manor."
"103224356-0-64603";"I found Reeve Nardarmor's private journal hidden behind a loose wall panel. They sent Snapdragon to Sunhold. I should talk to Tanlorin and show them what the reeve wrote."
"103224356-0-64604";"Tanlorin contacted Hyacinth using one of those magicka lattices. They want me to talk with Hyacinth and tell him about Snapdragon's arrest and our plan to go to Sunhold."
"103224356-0-64606";"Hyacinth had a magic circle set up on the beach. It allowed Tanlorin to focus their soul magic and enchant a nearby boat. Hyacinth believes the enchantment on the boat will allow us to quickly and safely reach Sunhold without being spotted."
"103224356-0-64608";"We safely made it to Sunhold. The Skywatch reeve's journal mentioned a prison cell on the west side of the city. We should search the area for an entrance that leads to this Ceythalmor location."
"103224356-0-64609";"Tanlorin opened the way to the Gardener's greenhouse using the portal curio Hyacinth provided. We should go through it before more Ceythalmor guards arrive."
"103224356-0-64610";"With Snapdragon safe in the Gardener's greenhouse, she wishes to speak to me. I should talk to her."
"103224356-0-64611";"A Ceythalmor prison warden guards the way to Snapdragon's cell. We need to deal with her if we're going to rescue Snapdragon.."
"103224356-0-64613";"The doors have been sealed, but the altar remains unstable. I should find Votary Nahlia to learn what to do next."
"103224356-0-64616";"My first adventure with a Luminary has reached an end. I should talk to Nahlia and prepare for my next journey."
"103224356-0-64627";"If anyone can help me learn about Scribing and the Luminaries, it's the Crow. I should speak with her about next steps."
"103224356-0-64628";"The Crow said Ulfsild left echoes behind for whoever would follow in her footsteps. There should be an Echo in the main hall to start me on my path."
"103224356-0-64629";"I found a pedestal with one of Ulfsild's echoes. I should listen to what it has to say."
"103224356-0-64630";"Ulfsild's echo mentioned something called the True-Sight Lens, which should be awaiting me in the library's east wing. I should search for it."
"103224356-0-64632";"I've read the Fable of the Indrik. Now the Crow wants me to look through Lens of True-Sight at a focal point."
"103224356-0-64633";"By looking through the True-Sight Lens, I've revealed annotations within the Fable of the Indrik. I should read the book again and see what Ulfsild had to say."
"103224356-0-64634";"I read the Fable of the Indrik and viewed the annotations left by Ulfsild. I should talk to the Crow about what comes next."
"103224356-0-64636";"The Crow landed near the standing stone and seems eager to talk. I should see what comes next."
"103224356-0-64637";"To enter the Indrik's domain I need to open its door. To do that, I need to form a key. I need to use the True-Sight Lens at focal points in the area to reveal wards, dispel them, and unveil the hidden key fragment nearby."
"103224356-0-64640";"The wards are dispelled and the first key fragment has been revealed."
"103224356-0-64642";"I'm on my own, the Crow has returned to the Scholarium. I need to find the set of wards hiding the second Indrik key fragment. I can use the fable in my pack as a guide."
"103224356-0-64644";"The wards are dispelled and the second key fragment has been revealed."
"103224356-0-64646";"With the first and second key fragments collected, I continue my journey for more Indrik wards. I should use the fable as a reference to see where to search next."
"103224356-0-64648";"The wards are dispelled and the third key fragment has been revealed."
"103224356-0-64650";"I collected the fragments and formed the key to the Indrik's door. To enter the Wing of the Indrik, I should make for the final location indicated in Ulfsild's annotations."
"103224356-0-64652";"The door to the Wing of the Indrik has been revealed. Now to head inside and meet my first Luminary face to face."
"103224356-0-64653";"The Indrik has asked that I place the Fable on a dais near a door. This will connect the path from his wing back to the Scholarium once more."
"103224356-0-64654";"The Wing of the Indrik is connected back to the Scholarium. I should speak to the Indrik again to learn what comes next."
"103224356-0-64656";"To prove my worth, the Indrik has presented me a number of challenges. I need to complete two from the list. I can decide which tasks I wish to take on and prove myself worthy of the Luminary's power."
"103224356-0-64657";"I've completed the challenges set out by the Indrik. Time to return to the Luminary and see what comes next."
"103224356-0-64658";"The Indrik has asked me to track down a fawn chased by a hunter, trapped in a wisp of its power. The Luminary told me that the southern Auridon cave called Del's Claim would be the place to pick up the trail."
"103224356-0-64659";"I've found the indrik fawn. The Indrik has asked me to dispel its power from the beast, releasing it from this burden placed upon it."
"103224356-0-64660";"The indrik fawn has been freed of the Luminary's power. It's time to return to the wing of the Indrik."
"103224356-0-64661";"I should speak to Nahlia and catch her up on my adventures."
"103224356-0-64664";"Before we can check the bank vault, Maerenah says we need a key to open the door. She thinks the bank clerk kept a spare vault key in a lockbox by their desk. I should look for it."
"103224356-0-64669";"Rosalyn, one of only two survivors in the vault, told us that her husband, Grivier, has been escorting townsfolk to safety. We should leave the bank and try to find Grivier and the others."
"103224356-0-64672";"I embarrassed the rival bakers and retrieved the sugar and flour they stole. I should speak with Apprentice Mogh now."
"103224356-0-64674";"Felande has offered me a free inn room at the Fertile Respite Inn in Skingrad. I should speak to her to learn more about the offer."
"103224356-0-64675";"I've agreed to become Felande's newest tenant. I should speak to her to finalize the deal."
"103224356-0-64676";"I should travel to Skingrad in West Weald and speak to Felande about the inn room located within the Fertile Respite Inn."
"103224356-0-64681";"I gave Apprentice Mogh his sugar and flour. Now I need to wait patiently as he prepares the Jubilee Cake."
"103224356-0-64682";"<<1>>  instructed me to place all three items on top of the Altar so we can choose the correct one to offer."
"103224356-0-64683";"Leramil's portal led somewhere she did not intend. I should look around."
"103224356-0-64685";"I helped Legionary Calvo Dorso reach the bell tower and signal for reinforcements. Now I should talk to Captain Dromius about my reward."
"103224356-0-64686";"We found more evidence that fatigue fever is being created here in this alchemical laboratory. We also found a letter ordering the alchemist to eliminate me and Ghrakug! While Yabren goes to warn him, I need to destroy this alchemical equipment."
"103224356-0-64687";"We found the groundskeeper hiding in his residence. I should ask him about the key to the catacombs and what happened here."
"103224356-0-64697";"Leramil believes Ithelia and Shardmarshal Vargas have reached the core of the Loom. We need to find them before Ithelia uses the Loom to rewrite history and destroy everything we know."
"103224356-0-64698";"We found an illusory bird near the landmark of woven branches depicted in the sketch. I should interact with it and discover our next clue."
"103224356-0-64702";"Legionary Caepio told us that the Recollection and their Daedric allies killed everyone but him. He says the Daedra opened a portal below the catacombs to bring in more soldiers. I need to find this portal."
"103224356-0-64703";"Tribune Alea and I entered the ruins below the catacombs. We found more Recollection down here guarding the way. We need to keep searching to find the portal."
