"211640654-0-6629";"With this loyal dog at your side, you have a companion who can help you make it through even the most treacherous of avalanches in Pale Pass and other mountainous areas … even if it has to pull you out from under a pile of fallen snow and detritus."
"211640654-0-6630";"You needn't know Conjuration magic to have an atronach companion—Clan Direnni mages have gifted bear cubs of that provenance to those they deem worthy. They can be oddly heart-warming despite their frosty form."
"211640654-0-6631";"This wolf's experiences with Dragons surpasses that of many Dragon Hunters. And it has chosen to be at your side! An excellent match, indeed."
"211640654-0-6632";"You've done it! You have the Chaos Ball! Time to rub your superior play in the opposition's faces!"
"211640654-0-6633";"Riding high on your latest triumph, you slam the Chaos Ball into the ground. Good idea? Maybe not. But it was fun to watch."
"211640654-0-6634";"Ooh, ouch, too hot to handle! Quick, pass along the Chaos Ball before it burns your hands!"
"211640654-0-6635";"Dragon Hunters like you deserve only the best beverage in the best container. Drink out of the horn of a Dragon—potentially one that you yourself have slain!"
"211640654-0-6636";"Khajiiti merchants insist that this ""Dragon call"" can summon the beasts as surely as a duck-call summons waterfowl. While its effect on Dragons remains a matter of debate, everyone agrees that its clatter reliably attracts irritated friends and neighbors."
"211640654-0-6637";"Dragon Hunters often polish a trophy from their past battles to help them focus before the next battle. This Dragon trophy is yours to focus upon. Perhaps polish it a little? It's got a speck right … there. No, no. There."
"211640654-0-6638";"The skulls of your enemies make fine containers for your favorite beverage. Here's to you, skulldrinker. Here's to you."
"211640654-0-6639";"Bats are cute, yes? And you want one hanging from your finger, of course. Only monsters don't want to let bats hang from their fingers. You're not a monster, are you?"
"211640654-0-6640";"The world can be an awful, terrible, no-good place filled with undead. Ward them all off with Arkay's help. (Caution: Does not actually ward off undead.)"
"211640654-0-6641";"Crafted with great care, this Dragonhorn replica celebrates your past triumph with Sai Sahan against Vahlokzin. Simply blow, and a wave emanates from it. It does not, however, affect Dragons."
"211640654-0-6642";"That sickening blue glow you picked up while adventuring in the Lair of Maarselok? Yeah, it's all over you. Just remember what Selene taught you, and you'll be rid of it in seconds!"
"211640654-0-6643";"Be the life of your party with this cute little skeleton marionette! It dances! It prances! It hangs from strings, ready for you to make it move! (Creepy skeleton voice not included.)"
"211640654-0-6644";"Shimmer with a variety of hues, taking on the colors of the famed opals of Yokuda, with this skin. Perfect for star-strewn celebrations in Sentinel and beyond."
"211640654-0-6646";"Fierce, unnatural storms swirl around the frozen island of Icereach, sinking ships and lashing the coasts of Skyrim. Fight your way through a frigid ruin and put an end to the unholy ritual at the eye of the storm!"
"211640654-0-6647";"A group of Nordic graverobbers slaughtered their way into a long-hidden burial ground, intent on stealing ancient remains. Help the sentinel, Shelaria, on her quest for revenge and oust these nefarious plunderers."
"211640654-0-6648";"A hat says much about the person wearing it, so pick yours carefully. For instance, this particular one speaks volumes about how much you love the Witches Festival. (Don't we all?)"
"211640654-0-6649";"The ice within which you contain your emotions is strong, but your rage is stronger. Express your fury with these cracked ice facial markings."
"211640654-0-6650";"When pushed, your white-hot rage breaks free of the icy cage you set around it, smashing your foes. Warn others of your wrathful inclinations with these markings."
"211640654-0-6651";"The call of a lawless life sings in your head each evening. Maybe you'll help someone who's struggling. Maybe you'll steal an arrogant mer's coin purse. Whatever the case, your chosen path is reflected by your choice of facial tattoo."
"211640654-0-6652";"To survive in Senchal, you've learned how to make the most of a bad situation. These bold markings prove that you have what it takes to shake your fist in the face of adversity and deprivation."
"211640654-0-6653";"You stand strong in the darkness, listening to its wishes. You are a Nocturnal Outlaw, and none should ever doubt your abilities. Remind them with this striking facial tattoo."
"211640654-0-6654";"The shadows are your friend, providing you with shelter … and opportunity. As a Nocturnal Outlaw, you deserve a body tattoo that expresses your true nature."
"211640654-0-6655";"The Cult of the New Moon demands much, and you've given it … and then some. Show off your affiliation with this stylized flame facial tattoo."
"211640654-0-6656";"You've found what you're looking for in the Cult of the New Moon. And you want everyone to know whose side you're on. Let the flame symbology of this eye-catching tattoo show them."
"211640654-0-6657";"""Within you is the spirit of the First Cat's Pride. Let us bring that golden fire to the surface so that others may gaze upon your spirit directly, then react with awe.""—Artist-Adept Aimira"
"211640654-0-6658";"""Your body knows much it doesn't tell. With artistry, we can call forth the First Cat's Pride so that you may guide others in Alkosh's path. They will see the golden fire on your body and follow.""—Artist-Adept Aimira"

"211640654-0-6664";"""After the last time someone tried to hug me at a Dark Anchor, I designed this attire. It's particularly effective at staving off such shows of … excessive and nonconsensual exuberance.""—Pelynwe the Untouchable"
"211640654-0-6665";"An experienced siegemaster might wish to observe any unusual defenses by surveying them firsthand. This gear provides protection while doing so."
"211640654-0-6666";"Flowers! For your head! Flaunt your colorful style with this hat, and bring floral joy to everyone around you."
"211640654-0-6667";"Let your grace and style shine with this glistening tiara. Perfect for Evening Star galas, royal balls, and days when you just want to sparkle."
"211640654-0-6668";"Had your eye on the prize a bit too much, eh? Well, cover up that wound with this stylish patch."
"211640654-0-6669";"Howling winds and piercing cold may give some heroes pause, but not you! Show off your icy determination with your frost-covered face."
"211640654-0-6670";"Applying this shimmery azure glow to your face tells everyone that you are a princess and are worthy of all the good things in life. What are those good things? Up to you, of course, because you're a princess!"
"211640654-0-6671";"Do you revel in cataclysmic forces? Is vindication best reflected in ruining all who thwart you? Perhaps you revere the destructive Daedric Prince Mehrunes Dagon. Whatever the case, this ruddy-hued skin reflects your true nature."
"211640654-0-6672";"Few can withstand the scorching heat and relentless desolation of the Deadlands. Those unlucky few who find themselves trapped there may encounter one of these scuttling horrors—a hideous reminder of their grim and eternal fate."
"211640654-0-6673";"The epitome of Dragonslaying mounts, this steed has not only braved dangers that would make lesser heroes cringe but serves as a worthy mount for one of your stature and experience. The fact that it has green glowing eyes makes it even more noteworthy."
"211640654-0-6674";"Only the Wasseek-haleel would breed such a colorful and sweet-natured horse-lizard. Ideal for those times when you're wandering through Murkmire, looking for trouble to quash."
"211640654-0-6675";"By forcing their steeds to consume the Blood of Coldharbour, the traitorous soldiers of Legion Zero created a war horse unlike any other. Adorned with fearsome barding and their sullen red colors, this is truly a mount to be feared."
"211640654-0-6676";"In times past, honored visitors and brave heroes joined Windhelm's annual ceremonial ride on the festively decorated steeds of the Winterbloom Warmblood herd. Now that they're more freely available, perhaps you can recapture the spirit of this tradition."
"211640654-0-6677";"The corrupting presence of Dark Aeon can twist the local wildlife, such as this wolf, into crystalline creatures. Green tendrils accompany you as you race on its back, providing you both with an otherworldly presence."
"211640654-0-6678";"This molten mount radiates heat and reeks of brimstone. Some Dark Elves swear that it emerged from the heart of Red Mountain itself, but they speak of this only in whispers. Those who seek such a blasphemous steed will find none better!"
"211640654-0-6679";"The result of a boastful Khajiiti mage's bizarre transmutation ritual, the Dark Opaline Steed shimmers with blues and purples, and waves of colorful light trail behind it. Course through any environment while looking stylish and almost ephemeral!"
"211640654-0-6680";"This kagouti-shaped frost atronach might just be the last thing an unfortunate apprentice warlock crafted before becoming its first victim. Perhaps you can tame this mount? If not, best have extra healing potions on hand for the inevitable bites."
"211640654-0-6681";"Two mages crafted this mount, then had a deadly falling out over whether to share their research. Now you can ride it into the frozen peaks of Skyrim with no problems … or enjoy its coolness in the blistering heat of the Alik'r."
"211640654-0-6682";"Most sorcerers scoff at the idea of imbuing the lumbering frost atronach with feline grace, but when summoned correctly, this frigid senche more than matches its warm-blooded peers in quiet and cunning. Perfect for a hero of your stature!"
"211640654-0-6683";"All the strength of a standard frost atronach, with all the nobility and grace of the equine form! Create a spectacle by riding into your favorite town on this mighty steed."
"211640654-0-6684";"Few mages possess the power to press a frost atronach into service—but twisting its form into that of a Dwarven spider? That takes a rare gift. And with the sun glinting off it as you ride it, you'll cut quite an imposing figure!"
"211640654-0-6685";"Orcish spellwrights rarely call for boons from Daedric realms beyond Malacath's Ashpit. Even so, the lure of a raging bear wrought from rock-hard ice is difficult to pass up."
"211640654-0-6686";"Many masters of the art of necromancy find this horse suits their taste exceedingly well, especially since it possesses no fear of the undead that often surround necromancers. It calls to you, does it not?"
"211640654-0-6687";"Taken from the crime-ridden back streets of Senchal and raised by scavengers, this mount lost an eye while defending its rider from pursuing guards. Now wearing a patch, the Howler is an ideal mount for doers of deadly deeds."
"211640654-0-6688";"Hunters riding these valiant steeds are often the first on the scene of a Dragon attack. With its ornate, jade-accented barding, and its fierce loyalty to its rider, this steed is a must-have for any veteran Dragon Hunter."
"211640654-0-6689";"""A mage from Lilmoth found a way to, ahem, 'tame' these green slimes. Yes, it will follow you around, leaving a disgusting trail of slime, but it's hardly docile. My apprentice's so-called 'pet' woke me by trying to engulf my face.""—Aleri Andalor"
